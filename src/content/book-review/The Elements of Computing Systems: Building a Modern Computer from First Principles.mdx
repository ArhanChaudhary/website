This book holds a special place in my heart. I finished reading it right after starting college, and it reignited my interest in reading for fun. It was my first genuine read since the beginning of high school (I cared about the books in my English classes *far* less than I'm willing to admit).

I have no way to better describe this book than what the authors wrote themselves: a "voyage of discovery." This book doesn't just teach you how computers work, it offers a free hands-on hardware (and then software) course readers are encouraged to follow throughout each chapter. The book and its associated projects present themselves in a narrative that makes the reader feel as if they're discovering these new, eye-opening concepts about computing themselves. It's an excitingly unique experience that makes everything all the more memorable.

My associated project [NAND](https://nand.arhan.sh/) was [#1 on hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40159278) and just recently breached [500 stars on GitHub](https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/NAND)! It's almost poetic just how perfect my experience with this book was.

I was so passionate about this book that I shot one of the authors a thank-you email!
