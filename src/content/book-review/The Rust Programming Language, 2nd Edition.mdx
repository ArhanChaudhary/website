My primary motivation for reading this was to complete Advent of Code 2023 in Rust. The writing is simple yet effective, and as a reference work, it basically achieves what you expect.

As far as my criticisms go, chapter 11.3 (lifetimes) simply wasn't explained well, and chapters 13 (iterators/closures) and 18 (pattern matching) should have been placed towards the beginning of the book. These are just nitpicks; the book is still incredibly well executed for such a complicated programming language.

This book serves its role as a welcoming introduction to Rust. While it doesn't cover everything, it's enough to motivate readers to research more complex Rust topics and spark passion.
