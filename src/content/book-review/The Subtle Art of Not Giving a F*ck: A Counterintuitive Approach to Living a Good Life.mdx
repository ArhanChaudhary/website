{/* cspell:ignore TLDR exuberated */}

It took me a long time to gather my thoughts about this book and give it a rating because I have mixed feelings about it. I picked up this book not because I felt like I needed self-help, but rather because I was curious about the genre. After finishing reading it, I can confidently say it was an incredibly positive experience! TLDR; the book lives up to its flashy name, but suffers a universal motivational baggage that comes with life advice in general.

Mark Manson calls out the disingenuousness of modern culture and embraces adversity in a uniquely memorable way. His writing style resembles a man-to-man conversation, littered with profane humor and witty analogies to help express his points. As dramatic as this sounds, his philosophy has helped discover my self-identity and shape my current values.

My only criticism in terms of the actual content is that the second half of the book seems to suddenly lose the unique charm exuberated by the first half. While still remaining meaningful, the book actually becomes a little boring towards the end.

Now, the nitty-gritty. Throughout the read, I couldn't help but notice a subconscious feeling of, well, emptiness. In my opinion, a fundamental problem with life advice is that it's addictive and *really* easy to ride a motivational high off of the feeling of being productive, when in reality nothing has changed at all. I can't help but ask myself how much of the book I've already forgotten and how much of its advice I convinced myself I didn't already know. To Mark's credit, this isn't really his fault. He even [admits himself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQB3viVFhPA) that most self-help books don't actually say anything new or original; it's about the presentation and packaging of the book that makes it empowering.

If you want to challenge your existing values and want another approach to living a good life, I highly recommend this book.
