Well, this is a bit embarrassing. If you haven't noticed already, I got a DNF (did not finish) average, yikes! Maybe it was nerves, or general bad luck, but I improperly started the timer for both my 4th and 5th solves. It was disorienting to realize that I had the worst average of the entire competition. Let's just move on.
