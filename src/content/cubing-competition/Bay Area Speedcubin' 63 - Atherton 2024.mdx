Once again, I went to this competition with my friend [Adrian](https://bithole.dev). We spent the morning helping build a Rubik's cube mural.

Now, the competition. I was pretty satisfied with my first round and qualified for the second round, but Adrian was just two spots away from qualifying D: .

After we got lost driving in an IKEA parking lot, I came back from lunch for round two. I can't say I share the same satisfaction with my performance towards the end of round two. For context, my times going into the fifth solve were: 14, 12, 11, and 12. I was on pace for a sub 12 average, which would have been an insane jump from the my previous personal best average of 14.41. After ending the fifth solve with a Jb perm, in a cruel twist of fate I plus two-ed a 12 second solve. *Youch.*

Adrian recorded a video of my dissatisfaction with my last solve. It was really funny; I shook my head and gave the most debilitating frown.

I still qualified for the next round, but tragically, I couldn't attend the semi-finals due to a scheduling conflict. Still, I would be lying if I said I didn't have fun.
