This the first competition I went to after the COVID-19 pandemic. *Unfortunately*, I only found out about it after the registration window deadline :( . Though, my friend [Adrian](https://bithole.dev) had already independently signed up for it, so I decided to go with him for the fun of it.

That was a good move! It was so refreshing and exciting to get back into cubing and reignite this nerdy hobby of mine. Adrian and I talked with other Bay Area cubers and ended up volunteering to judge for an entire hour. Max Park was there as well. We got his autograph, hooray!
