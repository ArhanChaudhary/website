This the first competition I went to after the COVID-19 pandemic. *Unfortunately*, I only found out about it after the registration window deadline :( . Though, my friend [Adrian](https://bithole.dev) had already independently signed up for it, so I decided to go with him for the fun of it.

That was a good move! It was so refreshing and exciting to get back into cubing and reignite this nerdy hobby of mine. Adrian and I ended up volunteering to judge for an entire hour, and then we had fun exploring the Berkeley landscape during lunch. Most importantly, Max Park was there! We got his autograph, hooray!
