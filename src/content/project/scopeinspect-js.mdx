scopeinspect-js is a Chrome extension that utilizes the [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/scopeinspect-js#:~:text=Chrome%20DevTools%20Protocol) to programmatically inspect internal JavaScript state that would otherwise be inaccessible, such as WeakSet entries, private class properties, and closure variables. It serves as an archaic answer to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4472529/accessing-variables-trapped-by-closure) forum post.
