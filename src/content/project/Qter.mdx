{/* cspell:ignore qter */}

Qter is a computer architecture that allows humans to perform computations by manipulating Rubik's Cube (or any twisty puzzle) by hand. Qter features its own programming language that compiles to Rubik's Cube moves. It can be physically executed by a human without needing to know how computers work.

A collaborative project with friends [Henry](https://hrovnyak.gitlab.io/) and [Asher](https://thegraycuber.github.io/).
