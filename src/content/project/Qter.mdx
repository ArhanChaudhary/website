Qter is a human-friendly Rubik's cube computer. This means you can compile a computer program and then act as a computer processor by physically turning a Rubik's cube to affect its computation, even if you have no knowledge of how computers work.

A collaborative project with friends [Henry](https://hrovnyak.gitlab.io/) and [Asher](https://thegraycuber.github.io/).
