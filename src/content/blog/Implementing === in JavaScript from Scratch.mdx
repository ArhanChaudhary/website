Yes, I know exactly what you're thinking.

> Reinventing the wheel? That's the most moronic idea I've ever heard since that guy who wanted to invade Russia in the winter.

And you're not wrong. For all practical purposes, this blog is pointless. If you were looking for a small code snippet to show off on your quirky little website, I hate to break it to you, but what you're about to read is so obscenely nutty that it only works on a legacy version of Chromium as an extension running millions of times slower.

The strict equality operator in JavaScript (===) compare two values for object equality. As you probably already know, this operator tests reference equality for non-primitive JavaScript values. In effect, because `{ foo: 42 } === { foo: 42 }` is `false`, implementing [spec-compliant](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/abstract-operations.html#sec-isstrictlyequal) functionality becomes much more interesting. I'm not talking about the obvious ways. Various other built-ins make object reference comparison trivial.

```js
let obj1 = { foo: 42 };
let obj2 = obj1;

Object.is(obj1, obj2) && console.log("same");
[obj1].includes(obj2) && console.log("same");
switch (obj1) {
  case obj2:
    console.log("same");
}
new Set().add(obj1).has(obj2) && console.log("same");
```

We will implement this basic operation on a far lower level. But what does that mean, and how else could JavaScript differentiate two objects that hold the same data? [Surface level research](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1997661/unique-object-identifier-in-javascript) yields nothing. Let's take a deep dive.

A few weeks ago I was looking into the Chromium DevTools heap profiler for a separate [blog](../true-private-state-in-javascript-a-chromium-rabbit-hole/) post of mine. I keenly noticed that the heap profiler distinguishes JavaScript objects by memory location. I might be able to utilize that to my advantage, thus revealing a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel.

```js
let obj1 = { foo: 42 };
let obj2 = { foo: 42 };
```
<ContentImage src={heapProfiler} alt="The heap profiler demonstrating that two objects have different memory locations" />

This isn't useful if there isn't a way to access these memory locations programmatically. Fortunately, there exists a standardized JavaScript API that fits my needs named the [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol), or CDP. It allows for direct inspection into the JavaScript runtime on Blink-based browsers. Sure enough, Chrome DevTools uses this protocol for the heap profiler.

The original question still stands; how does JavaScript access the CDP? The documentation endorses two means of access. First, open [devtools-on-devtools](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12291138/how-do-you-inspect-the-web-inspector-in-chrome/12291163#12291163) and interface with the CDP like so.

```js
let Main = await import('./devtools-frontend/front_end/entrypoints/main/main.js');
await Main.MainImpl.sendOverProtocol('Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride', {
  mobile: true,
  width: 412,
  height: 732,
  deviceScaleFactor: 2.625,
});

const data = await Main.MainImpl.sendOverProtocol("Page.captureScreenshot");
```

This requires explicit access to DevTools and some setup, meaning it wouldn't plainly work on a website. The alternative option was the `chrome.debugger` API within a Chrome extension. Although this would be a bit harder to work with, it was actually programmatic and eventually the option I chose.

I hacked up a Chrome extension but was surprised when my testing errored with the following message.

```json
{"code":-32601,"message":"'HeapProfiler.enable' wasn't found"}
```

What's going on here? As it turns out, [internal documentation](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/third_party/blink/public/devtools_protocol/#security-considerations) reveals that specific Protocol Domains are restricted for security reasons.

> However, since the protocol is also exposed to chrome extensions through chrome.debugger API, the backend implements additional access control in some of the methods to prevent extensios form accessing file system or otherwise escaping the sandbox. These restrictions are not extended to other types of clients.

[Here](https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8/+/c42e620355453fc0510b06e089ca7d92598bd54f%5E%21/) is the v8 commit that adds these restrictions, dating May 2022 and Chromium version v103. You guessed what's going to happen next. The solution to our dilemma, of course, is time travel.

[Archives](https://www.slimjet.com/chrome/google-chrome-old-version.php) of older versions of Chrome exist online. However, I'm wary of downloading unknown files from the Internet. Instead, I installed an official Chromium build from source following their [guide](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium/#downloading-old-builds-of-chrome-chromium). Note that you may have to run `/usr/bin/xattr -cr /Applications/Chromium.app` on an M1 Mac to fix broken metadata preventing Chromium from launching.

My extension didn't initially work because global content scripts were only [supported](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/8f07eaff87947a2e93214de2695de8052119180b) in Chromium v111, so I had to resort to an [older](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9602022/chrome-extension-retrieving-global-variable-from-webpage/9636008#9636008) content script hack to get it to work.

That was a lot, let's take a small step back. To reiterate, the goal is to implement a [spec-compliant](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/abstract-operations.html#sec-isstrictlyequal) strict equality operation in JavaScript from scratch.  We've found a version of Chromium that enables programmatic access to the DevTools heap profiler. Let's build the bridge between the CDP and JavaScript object memory addresses.

A good place to start is the [HeapProfiler.takeHeapSnapshot](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/HeapProfiler/#method-takeHeapSnapshot) method. This will profile the *entire* page, and is obviously cumbersome, but whatever. Next, the [Runtime.evaluate](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Runtime/#method-evaluate) method creates a unique object identifier. The caveat is that this only evaluates the global scope, coercing some quite bizarre JavaScript.

`strictEquality.js`
```js
async function strictEquality(obj1, obj2) {
  window.__obj1 = obj1;
  window.__obj2 = obj2;
  // Communicate with the extension content script
  // and perform the strict equality
  document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("strictEquality"));
  let e = await new Promise((resolve) =>
    document.addEventListener("strictEqualityResponse", resolve, { once: true })
  );
  delete window.__obj1;
  delete window.__obj2;
  if (e.detail.length) {
    throw new Error(e.detail);
  } else {
    return e.detail;
  }
}
```

Ugh. It's async not because of I/O, but because of the event loop. It's also non-reentrant and must be prefixed with `await`. These types of unavoidable stateful functions are typically only present within C, not JavaScript!

Fine. Finally, we can pass that identifier to [HeapProfiler.getHeapObjectId](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/HeapProfiler/#method-getHeapObjectId) and earn our heap profiler memory address value.

Given the lengths I've taken to get this far, these are all compromises I'm willing to bear with xD. The full pipeline:

`background.js`
```js
...
await chrome.debugger.attach({ tabId }, "1.3");
await chrome.debugger.sendCommand({ tabId }, "HeapProfiler.takeHeapSnapshot");
let objDetails = await Promise.all([
  chrome.debugger.sendCommand({ tabId }, "Runtime.evaluate", {
    expression: "window.__obj1",
  }),
  chrome.debugger.sendCommand({ tabId }, "Runtime.evaluate", {
    expression: "window.__obj2",
  }),
]);
let objHeapDetails = await Promise.all([
  chrome.debugger.sendCommand({ tabId }, "HeapProfiler.getHeapObjectId", {
    objectId: objDetails[0].result.objectId,
  }),
  chrome.debugger.sendCommand({ tabId }, "HeapProfiler.getHeapObjectId", {
    objectId: objDetails[1].result.objectId,
  }),
]);
await chrome.debugger.detach({ tabId: sender.tab.id });

sendResponse(
  !(
    objHeapDetails[0].heapSnapshotObjectId -
    objHeapDetails[1].heapSnapshotObjectId
  )
);
...
```

We're almost done! We now just need to handle important edge cases. Because primitive types are easy copy, `Runtime.evaluate` skips to the last step and directly returns their value, probably because they aren't usually stored on the heap and instead on the stack (with the exception of Symbols).

```js
window.__obj1 = { foo: 42 };
```
```json
{
  "className": "Object",
  "description": "Object",
  "objectId": "...",
  "type": "object"
}
```
```js
window.__obj1 = 42;
```
```json
{
  "description": "42",
  "type": "number",
  "value": 42
}
```

While in theory this would be a simple equality operation, I wanted to stay true to my word and avoid its use entirely. Rather, we need to implement the [isStrictlyEqual](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/abstract-operations.html#sec-isstrictlyequal) subroutine at the high level like so.

`background.js`
```js
...
function primitiveEquality(p1, p2) {
  if (p1.subtype) {
    p1.type = p1.subtype;
  }
  if (p2.subtype) {
    p2.type = p2.subtype;
  }
  if (!stringEquality(p1.type, p2.type)) {
    return false;
  }
  if (stringEquality(p1.type, "number")) {
    if (
      stringEquality(p1.description, "NaN") ||
      stringEquality(p2.description, "NaN")
    ) {
      return false;
    }
    if (
      (stringEquality(p1.description, "0") &&
        stringEquality(p2.description, "-0")) ||
      (stringEquality(p1.description, "-0") &&
        stringEquality(p2.description, "0"))
    ) {
      return true;
    }
    if (p1.unserializableValue || p2.unserializableValue) {
      return stringEquality(p1.description, p2.description);
    }
    return !(p1.value - p2.value);
  }
  if (stringEquality(p1.type, "null") || stringEquality(p1.type, "undefined")) {
    return true;
  }
  if (stringEquality(p1.type, "bigint")) {
    return stringEquality(p1.description, p2.description);
  }
  if (stringEquality(p1.type, "string")) {
    return stringEquality(p1.value, p2.value);
  }
  if (stringEquality(p1.type, "boolean")) {
    return !(p1.value - p2.value);
  }
  throw new Error("Unsupported primitive type");
}

function stringEquality(str1, str2) {
  if (str1.length - str2.length) {
    return false;
  }
  for (let i = 0; i < str1.length; i++) {
    if (str1.charCodeAt(i) - str2.charCodeAt(i)) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}
```

And... there we go. The full implementation is provided in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/strictequality-js). I'm not sure what you should take out of this blog post. There's no point in trying to sugarcoat it. This reimplementation of strict equality in JavaScript is at rock bottom, hanging by a thread. It's async, (really) slow, outdated, and displays the most annoying "This extension is debugging this browser" banner. Did I also mention that because content scripts don't work globally it doesn't work on document load? You'll have to have fun awaiting the `strictEqualityLoaded` event before usage.

Hey, at least it was really cool. Until next time!
