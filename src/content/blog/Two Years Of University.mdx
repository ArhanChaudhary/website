Throughout my teenage years, college felt like a mystery. I had a general idea of what life was like *after* college, through TV shows, my parents, and the Internet. And, at that time, I was exactly living through life *before* college. College *itself*, on the other hand, was a black box, where people go into, are never heard from again until after four years, and magically transform into adults. I had no idea what to expect from going into college, and would often be met with the dull "it's the best time of your life" and "it's a place to discover yourself." Maybe I was just ignorant, but this was overwhelmingly how I felt. I cried on my first night in my dorm room.

Now, I completed two years as a CS major and ECE minor at Purdue University! Okay, I still have two more weeks before the year ends, but whatever. Sue me. If you are expecting me to say something meaningful about the college experience, I'm not going to pretend like the conventional advice about college is untrue. It would feel disingenuous to try regurgitating it. This is my blog after all, so let's go over what's happened since my last [update](../hello-world).

# I ditched the skateboard

From the beginning to end of 2024, I learned how to skateboard, became moderately good at it, and quit without looking back. On my way to class, my back foot hit the back wheel while pushing off my board sending me tumbling into the asphalt. It was a very rough fall, and I eventually turned out fine, but I was spooked enough when it happened *again* that I decided skateboarding wasn't worth jeopardizing my well-being. Oh well, I'm glad I tried it out.

# I uninstalled social media

I used to be morbidly addicted to social media. Quintessential Gen Z stuff, I know. I'm not entirely clean, I still [watch](/media) a lot of YouTube, my last vice, but I've phased out everything else from my life. Ultimately, it never mattered to me. I am proud to say that I have recently been spending my time focusing on things I care about.

# I took interesting classes

I declared a minor in electrical computer engineering! This semester I finished my first electrical engineering fundamentals class, absolutely loving it, albeit scary at first. Truthfully, I wasn't confident about taking up the minor; it’s not something you usually hear CS majors doing. Compared to other minors, I had to take triple the number of classes, forcing me to stay at Purdue for all four years. It’s not particularly helpful on a resume either. Don't get me wrong, while an ECE minor is nice to show off, there are better time investments into my career for my major. From my point of view, these arguments were missing the point of a minor. Every day, my AP Physics C class from high school was part of the few I genuinely looked forward towards. I would never be able to live with myself if I passed up the opportunity to take advantage of [one of the best engineering programs in the world](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr) and Purdue's maker space culture.

Throughout my career as a student, I hated English class. The word "hate" isn't used lightly; I felt misunderstood, loathing the subject day and night. I fell into a defeatist, closed-minded mindset, and actively refused to read because it was never something I thought I could get good at. Fast forward to my previous semester at university, I had the option to fulfill my writing requirement with an easy class I wouldn't really care about. I gave myself one more opportunity, and reluctantly signed up for a discussion-based reading and writing class. I’m so happy I did, it was my favorite class this semester! As much as I love computers, our daily discussions , and We read Hamlet, The Odyssey, The Inferno, and Frankenstein, none of which I was familiar with. I looked forward to our daily discussions about every night’s reading. One thing this class made me realize was that I hadn’t actually personally known a professor at Purdue. The smaller class size made our relationships tight-knit.

# Upcoming blog posts

Along the way, I did end up getting a lot of new blogpost ideas, some of which I am currently working on. Time has been hard to come by ever since starting college, but I still think that blogging is just a great way to share cool stuff and I want to keep doing it.

So.. stay tuned. Because there's always more to come :-)
