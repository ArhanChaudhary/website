Throughout my teenage years, college felt like a mystery. I had a general idea of what life was like *after* college, through TV shows, my parents, and the Internet. And, at that time, I was exactly living through life *before* college. College *itself*, on the other hand, was a black box, where people go into, are never heard from again until after four years, and magically transform into adults. I had no idea what to expect from going into college, and would often be met with the dull "it's the best time of your life" and "it's a place to discover yourself." Maybe I was just ignorant, but this was overwhelmingly how I felt. I cried on my first night in my dorm room.

Now, I just got through two years as a CS major and ECE minor at Purdue University! Okay, I still have two more weeks before the year ends, but whatever. Sue me. If you are expecting me to say something meaningful about the college experience, I'm not going to pretend like the conventional advice about college is untrue. It would feel disingenuous to try regurgitating it. This is my blog after all, so let's go over what's happened since my last [update](../hello-world).

# I ditched the skateboard

From the beginning to end of 2024, I learned how to skateboard, became moderately good at it, and quit without looking back. On my way to class, my back foot hit the back wheel while pushing off my board sending me tumbling into the asphalt. It was a very rough fall, and I eventually turned out fine, but I was spooked enough when it happened *again* that I decided skateboarding wasn't worth jeopardizing my well-being. Oh well, I'm glad I tried it out.

# I uninstalled social media

I used to be morbidly addicted to social media. Quintessential Gen Z stuff, I know. I'm not entirely clean, I still [watch](/media) a lot of YouTube, my last vice, but I've phased out everything else from my life. Ultimately, it never mattered to me. I am proud to say that I have recently been spending my time focusing on things I care about.
