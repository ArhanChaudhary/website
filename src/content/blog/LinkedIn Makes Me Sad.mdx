description: And there's nothing you can do about it
---

We have all had the universal experience of creating a LinkedIn account.

thought it was silly but never found the joke
shallow and fake, on the polar opposite site LinkedIn is an excuse for AI techies to have a god-complex
"feel good" content relating to AI
reels??

LinkedIn makes me sad because there's nothing you can do about it. Its role as a professional social media platform is a necessity of the professional world.

It's not going anywhere either; companies view LinkedIn not as a social media platform, but as an investment. Inertia

It also makes me sad because it had so much potential to be better. Better values
