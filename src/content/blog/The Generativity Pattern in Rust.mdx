# Background

The *generativity pattern* in Rust is a combination of [typestate](https://cliffle.com/blog/rust-typestate/) and [GhostCell](https://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt/ghostcell/), techniques that eliminate runtime overhead through compile-time safety guarantees. This pattern is not commonplace; its usage warrants a specific set of circumstances. Aside from thinly spread (but admittedly well-written) academic literature, I haven't a found an accessible analysis of this pattern online. Contrary to its name, this post won't be about the generativity pattern until the end. In order to build up a full picture of the "what," and more importantly the "why," we will walk through a realistic example to gradually build an intuition of the type of problem generativity can solve.

Let's take the role of a crate author about permutations. We want to investigate the [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_group#Composition_of_permutations–the_group_product) of permutations. This can be expressed nicely visually.

<PermutationExample />

The permutation `b` defines the remapping of the elements from permutation `a`. Pretty simple. Notice that permutation composition is only possible under the following three conditions:

1. `a` and `b` have the same length.
2. Each element from `a` and `b` must be less than or equal to the length.
3. Each element from `a` and `b` is unique.

Our library is general-purpose, so it is important to handle these error cases. Here is the simplest way to do that.

```rust
// We provide a `compose_into` function in case the caller already has
// a permutation preallocated. (This is good practice IMO).
pub fn compose_into(a: &[usize], b: &[usize], into: &mut [usize]) -> Result<(), &'static str> {
    if a.len() != b.len() || b.len() != into.len() {
        return Err("Permutations must have the same length");
    }
    let mut seen_b = vec![false; a.len()];
    let mut seen_a = vec![false; b.len()];
    for (into_value, &b_value) in into.iter_mut().zip(b) {
        if *seen_b
            .get(b_value)
            .ok_or("B contains an element greater than the length")?
        {
            return Err("B contains repeated elements");
        }
        seen_b[b_value] = true;

        let a_value = a[b_value];
        if *seen_a
            .get(a_value)
            .ok_or("A contains an element greater than the length")?
        {
            return Err("A contains repeated elements");
        }
        seen_a[a_value] = true;

        *into_value = a_value;
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

Good on you if this made you uneasy. Rust allows us to guarantee at the type level that `a` and `b` are valid permutations, using the [newtype](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/patterns/behavioural/newtype.html) design pattern.

```rust
pub struct Permutation(Box<[usize]>);

impl Permutation {
    pub fn from_mapping(mapping: Vec<usize>) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        // ... validate that `mapping` is a valid permutation
        Ok(Permutation(mapping.into_boxed_slice()))
    }

    pub fn compose_into(&self, b: &Self, into: &mut Self) -> Result<(), &'static str> {
        if self.0.len() != into.0.len() || b.0.len() != into.0.len() {
            return Err("Permutations must have the same length");
        }
        for (into_value, &b_value) in into.0.iter_mut().zip(&b.0) {
            // SAFETY: `b` is guaranteed to be a valid permutation
            // whose elements can index `self`
            *into_value = unsafe { *self.0.get_unchecked(b_value) };
        }
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn compose(&self, b: &Self) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        let mut result = Self(vec![0; self.0.len()].into_boxed_slice());
        self.compose_into(b, &mut result)?;
        Ok(result)
    }
}
```

The newtype pattern is more useful than just for getting around the orphan rule. We restrict construction of `Permutation` to the `from_mapping` method, which returns an error if the input is not a valid permutation. That means if we have an instance of `Permutation`, we don't have to worry about its mapping being potentially invalid before using it. Rustaceans describe type-level guarantees like this by saying an *invariant* of `Permutation` is that it represents a valid permutation. Composing two permutations upholds this invariant, so we expose `compose` to create a new `Permutation` from existing ones.

This code is a major improvement! It is simple, easy to use, and it provides reasonable errors. However, a closer examination reveals some problems:

- Every call to our composition function spends time performing a length check. Our example is simplistic so it happens to be cheap, but this type of check may require more expensive logic in a practical scenario.
- Returning a `Result` forces the caller to be prepared to handle the error case. Library users might be able to guarantee that the length checks will pass, which would make the error handling more annoying than helpful.

Yes, these aren't *important* problems per se, but they are still inconveniences to be aware of.

We now want to extend our library to model a [permutation group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_group), or just a representation of a bunch of permutations. In a permutation group, every permutation can be written as a sequence of compositions of base permutations. For example, the manipulations of the Rubik's Cube form a permutation group. Its base permutations are the six face rotations. Therefore, every possible state on the Rubik's cube can be reached from a combination of those face rotations. The illustrated turn is a permutation fifty-four elements long, because there are fifty-four stickers on a Rubik's cube.

<ContentImage src={stickeredCube} width="300" alt="The solved Rubik's cube" />

It follows that if you compose two permutations in a permutation group, the resulting permutation will also be a permutation in that group. The reasoning is not so relevant; take this at face value.

A reasonable data structure for permutation groups looks like this.

```rust
pub struct PermGroup {
    base_permutation_length: usize,
    base_permutations: Vec<Permutation>,
}

impl PermGroup {
    pub fn new(
        base_permutation_length: usize,
        base_permutation_mappings: Vec<Vec<usize>>,
    ) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        // ... validate that each mapping is a valid
        // permutation of the given length
        // (remember that permutations can only be
        // composed if they have the same length)
        Ok(Self {
            base_permutation_length,
            base_permutations: base_permutation_mappings
                .into_iter()
                .map(Permutation::from_mapping)
                .collect::<Result<_, _>>()?,
        })
    }

    pub fn base_permutations(&self) -> &[Permutation] {
        &self.base_permutations
    }
}
```

Your *inner Ferris* awakens. With the annoyances of our last iteration freshly in memory, you ask yourself: can we perform the length check once during the creation of the permutation group, and avoid it entirely in our permutation composition function? Then, can we tweak our composition function to only operate on permutations from the same permutation group?

```rust
impl Permutation {
    pub(crate) fn from_mapping(mapping: Vec<usize>) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        // ... validate that `mapping` is a valid permutation
        Ok(Permutation(mapping.into_boxed_slice()))
    }

    pub fn compose_into(&self, b: &Permutation, into: &mut Permutation) {
        for i in 0..into.0.len() {
            unsafe {
                *into.0.get_unchecked_mut(i) = *self.0.get_unchecked(*b.0.get_unchecked(i));
            }
        }
    }

    pub fn compose(&self, b: &Permutation) -> Permutation {
        let mut result = Permutation(vec![0; self.0.len()].into_boxed_slice());
        self.compose_into(b, &mut result);
        result
    }
}
```

All of a sudden, we've opened up an unsafety hole! We implicitly assumed that the permutations to compose were from the same permutation group. This is not necessarily true—what if a library user composes two base permutations from different permutation groups? If the permutation lengths *don't* match, then `get_unchecked` will exhibit undefined behavior; this is clearly a problem! The intent of this operation is obviously nonsensical, but it does not change the fact that it is still our responsibility, as the crate author, that the safe functions we provide can never exhibit undefined behavior.

There is a more fundamental reason to care. An invariant of permutation composition within the same permutation group is membership; if the permutations to compose are in the same permutation group, the resulting permutation is also in that group. Even if the lengths of permutations from two different permutation groups *did* match, composing them could produce a permutation outside of either permutation group, which is a logic error. Mitigating this by checking permutation group membership every function call is a very expensive operation. This is an example of the "practical scenario" I mentioned beforehand.

We will analyze different approaches that ensure our library only permits permutation composition from the same permutation group. Each has their own trade-offs, but are all right answers for their own dedicated situations. They will also lay the groundwork to justify using the generativity pattern. All the code segments provided in this article can be found [here](https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/generativity-pattern-rs).

# The unsafe approach

The simplest solution is to mark `compose_into` unsafe.

```rust
impl Permutation {
    // ...

    /// # Safety
    ///
    /// `self`, `b`, and `into` must all be from the same permutation group.
    pub unsafe fn compose_into(&self, b: &Permutation, into: &mut Permutation) {
        for i in 0..into.0.len() {
            unsafe {
                *into.0.get_unchecked_mut(i) = *self.0.get_unchecked(*b.0.get_unchecked(i));
            }
        }
    }
    // ...
}
```

Although the extent of the undefined behavior with permutation composition is just the bounds checking, the goal of this approach is to enforce permutation group membership. Thus, the safety contract is made more restrictive to reflect this idea. This usage of unsafe is nebulous. For permutations of the same length that violate the safety contract, composition is a logic error, but not technically unsafe. Sure, you might panic later on or get some other issue, but this alone will never violate the memory rules.

To play devil's advocate, one may consider producing an invalid value from this type of composition undefined behavior, since we only care about composition within the same permutation group. With the safety contract's additional restriction, all calling code no longer has to handle this logic error while gaining the benefit of this assumption. It is [generally agreed upon](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/should-i-use-unsafe-merely-to-encourage-users-to-maintain-invariants/27856) that unsafe should not be used for the sole purpose of maintaining validity invariants. Personally, I believe this use of unsafe is warranted. I encourage you to have your own opinion.

If you don't care about using unsafe—and there are valid reasons not to—then this might be what you want. That said, it's not always going to be this simple. What if you introduce a new trait, `ComposablePermutation`, that generalizes over different permutation representations? For example, the `PSHUFB` instruction can compose two permutations in a single clock cycle if they have less than sixteen elements.

```rust
pub trait ComposablePermutation: Clone {
    fn from_mapping(mapping: Vec<usize>) -> Result<Self, &'static str>;

    /// # Safety
    ///
    /// `self`, `b`, and `into` must all be from the same permutation group.
    unsafe fn compose_into(&self, b: &Self, into: &mut Self);
    /// # Safety
    ///
    /// `self` and `b` must both be from the same permutation group.
    unsafe fn compose(&self, b: &Self) -> Self {
        let mut result = self.clone();
        unsafe { self.compose_into(b, &mut result) };
        result
    }
}

impl ComposablePermutation for Permutation {
    // ...
}
```

The consequences of using unsafe begin to show. Because our generic `Permutation` implements `ComposablePermutation`, and we have shown that permutation composition from different permutation groups is unsound, `compose_into` must be made unsafe at the trait level. Rust doesn't allow us to only make `Permutation`'s implementation unsafe; either all implementors must be made unsafe, or none at all. In a library *about* permutation composition, we have now forced our users to wrangle with unsafe for its most essential operation. Not just with `Permutation::compose_into`, but with all of their own implementations of `ComposablePermutation`.

*"That is completely unfair!"* You might say. *"This is a small edge condition I don't care about. I'm going to mark this trait method safe anyways."* Well, the Rust community generally has a zero-tolerance stance on undefined behavior; the last time someone wanted to mark an unsound method safe, [it didn't end very well](https://github.com/ogxd/gxhash/issues/82#issuecomment-2257578785).

# The atomic ID approach

The second approach is to validate input permutations *upfront* and use a private integer to uniquely associate them to a permutation group. This simplifies the test for permutation group membership to a cheap integer comparison. Code often speaks louder than words, so I have provided the full implementation of this approach which will be followed by an analysis on its significance. I really encourage you to internalize how this works and think about why this sound.

```rust
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicU64, Ordering::Relaxed};

pub struct PermGroup {
    base_permutation_length: usize,
    base_permutations: Vec<Permutation>,
    id: u64,
}

static ID: AtomicU64 = AtomicU64::new(0);

impl PermGroup {
    pub fn new(
        base_permutation_length: usize,
        base_permutation_mappings: Vec<Vec<usize>>,
    ) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        // ... validate that each mapping is a valid
        // permutation of the given length
        let id = ID.fetch_add(1, Relaxed);
        Ok(Self {
            base_permutation_length,
            base_permutations: base_permutation_mappings
                .into_iter()
                .map(|mapping| Permutation(mapping.into_boxed_slice(), id))
                .collect(),
            id,
        })
    }

    pub fn permutation_from_mapping(
        &self,
        mapping: Vec<usize>,
    ) -> Result<Permutation, &'static str> {
        let permutation = Permutation::from_mapping(mapping, self.id)?;
        // ... validate that `permutation` is a member of this group
        Ok(permutation)
    }

    pub fn base_permutations(&self) -> &[Permutation] {
        &self.base_permutations
    }
}

pub struct Permutation(Box<[usize]>, u64);

impl Permutation {
    pub(crate) fn from_mapping(mapping: Vec<usize>, id: u64) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        // ... validate that `mapping` is a valid permutation
        // that is a member of this group
        Ok(Permutation(mapping.into_boxed_slice(), id))
    }

    pub fn compose_into(&self, b: &Self, into: &mut Self) -> Result<(), &'static str> {
        if self.1 != b.1 || self.1 != into.1 {
            return Err("Permutations must come from the same permutation group");
        }
        for i in 0..into.0.len() {
            unsafe {
                *into.0.get_unchecked_mut(i) = *self.0.get_unchecked(*b.0.get_unchecked(i));
            }
        }
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn compose(&self, b: &Self) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        let mut result = Permutation(vec![0; self.0.len()].into_boxed_slice(), self.1);
        self.compose_into(b, &mut result)?;
        Ok(result)
    }
}
```

(WIP from here on)

Permutation takes Id instead of PermGroup

No longer as contentious, the Rust standard library seems to [agree](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.from_utf8_unchecked).

# The generativity approach

The fundamental problem is that the validity invariant of `Permutation` guarantees it is a valid permutation, but not that it is associated with a specific `PermGroup`.

'id is contagious

What would really be nice is an *infallible* composition operation; one that we can guarantee is correct at the type level.

```rust
use generativity::{Guard, Id};

pub struct PermGroup<'id> {
    base_permutation_length: usize,
    base_permutations: Vec<Permutation<'id>>,
    id: Id<'id>,
}

impl<'id> PermGroup<'id> {
    pub fn new(
        base_permutation_length: usize,
        base_permutation_mappings: Vec<Vec<usize>>,
        guard: Guard<'id>,
    ) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        // ... validate that each mapping is a valid
        // permutation of the given length
        // (remember that permutations can only be composed
        // if they have the same length)
        let id = guard.into();
        Ok(Self {
            base_permutation_length,
            base_permutations: base_permutation_mappings
                .into_iter()
                .map(|mapping| Permutation::from_mapping(mapping, id))
                .collect::<Result<_, _>>()?,
            id,
        })
    }

    pub fn permutation_from_mapping(
        &self,
        mapping: Vec<usize>,
    ) -> Result<Permutation<'id>, &'static str> {
        let permutation = Permutation::from_mapping(mapping, self.id)?;
        // ... validate that `permutation` is a member of this group
        Ok(permutation)
    }

    pub fn base_permutations(&self) -> &[Permutation<'id>] {
        &self.base_permutations
    }
}

pub struct Permutation<'id>(Box<[usize]>, Id<'id>);

impl<'id> Permutation<'id> {
    pub(crate) fn from_mapping(mapping: Vec<usize>, id: Id<'id>) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        // ... validate that `mapping` is a valid permutation
        Ok(Self(mapping.into_boxed_slice(), id))
    }

    pub fn compose_into(&self, b: &Self, into: &mut Self) {
        for i in 0..into.0.len() {
            unsafe {
                *into.0.get_unchecked_mut(i) = *self.0.get_unchecked(*b.0.get_unchecked(i));
            }
        }
    }

    pub fn compose(&self, b: &Self) -> Self {
        let mut result = Permutation(vec![0; self.0.len()].into_boxed_slice(), self.1);
        self.compose_into(b, &mut result);
        result
    }
}
```

It's useful anytime you want to guarantee that two values come from or refer to the same source. Then give a list of bullet points that all need to be true to use generativity

Lifetimes in Rust are usually used to track the scopes during which mutable and
shared references are valid, but in the case of GhostCell and GhostToken, the brand lifetime 'id
is not actually used as a lifetime rather, it merely serves as a static representative of the collection
to which all the nodes of type `GhostCell<'id, _>` belong.

This may be old news to some, `BrandedVec` & GhostCell

"This implies that we, as the developer of the library, have
the obligation to prove that such accesses are actually safe under all possible interactions with well-typed clients."

Does not use a closure

[Aria Desires' Master's thesis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gankro/thesis/master/thesis.pdf)
"Hacking Generativity into Rust", right before she says "we really don’t recommend doing this".

<Aside>

As this StackOverflow user [points out](https://stackoverflow.com/a/76876800), you can achieve something similar using an anonymous "invariant token" unit struct and a macro to create the permutation group. Successive calls to this macro will create permutation groups with a unique brand.

```rust
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! new_perm_group {
    ($len:expr, $mappings:expr) => {{
        let len = $len;
        let mappings = $mappings;
        struct InvariantToken;
        // SAFETY: private API, only used in this macro
        unsafe {
            $crate::PermGroup::<InvariantToken>::new(len, mappings)
        }
    }};
}
```

```rust
let first_perm_group = new_perm_group!(4, vec![vec![1, 2, 0, 3]]).unwrap();
let second_perm_group = new_perm_group!(3, vec![vec![2, 0, 1]]).unwrap();
let first_perm = &first_perm_group.base_permutations()[0];
let second_perm = &second_perm_group.base_permutations()[0];

first_perm.compose(second_perm); // Compile error!
```

The flaw is quite subtle. This [implementation](https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/generativity-pattern-rs/blob/main/src/6-unsound-token.rs) creates a token per-*call* instead of per-*owner*. If you can create multiple owners in the same macro call, it will give each the same brand.

```rust
let first = (4, vec![vec![1, 2, 0, 3]]);
let second = (3, vec![vec![2, 0, 1]]);

let perm_groups = [first, second]
    .into_iter()
    .map(|(len, mappings)| new_perm_group!(len, mappings).unwrap())
    .collect::<Vec<_>>();
let first_perm = &perm_groups[0].base_permutations()[0];
let second_perm = &perm_groups[1].base_permutations()[0];

first_perm.compose(second_perm); // No compile error, UB!
```

We have just invoked undefined behavior from safe user-facing code. This is unsound with question, and there is no point endorsing this approach. This offers another perspective as to why `generativity`'s lifetimes are so restrictive;

</Aside>

# Benchmarks

No comparison would be complete without a benchmark. Yes, the point of the generativity pattern is more fundamental than just speed, but I know what people want. I statically generated two random length-fifteen permutations and wrote a Criterion benchmark for all five approaches to permutation composition.

| Benchmark Name | Time (ns)
| - | -
| 1-slice | 14.805
| 2-newtype | 4.257
| 4-atomic-id | 3.940
| 5-generativity | 3.604
| 3-unsafe-trait | 3.602

Empirically, this validates all of my observations. The naive `1-slice` is the slowest because it checks every permutation for complete validity. `2-newtype` removes most of the validation overhead. Admittedly this is good enough; you would only care about the other solutions if you could prove that permutation composition was the bottleneck. `4-atomic-id` replaces the validation with a simple integer comparison, making it marginally faster. Finally, `5-generativity` and `3-unsafe-trait` emerge the fastest because they avoid validation entirely. The important difference: `3-unsafe-trait` marks permutation composition unsafe while `5-generativity` does not.

# How does generativity work?

Generativity is a limited system that can solve some of the problems usually re-served for dependent typing.
