# Background

The *generativity pattern* in Rust is a combination of [typestate](https://cliffle.com/blog/rust-typestate/) and [GhostCell](https://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt/ghostcell/), techniques that eliminate runtime overhead through compile-time safety guarantees. This pattern is not commonplace; its usage warrants a specific set of circumstances. Aside from thinly spread (but admittedly well-written) academic literature, I haven't a found an accessible analysis of this pattern online. In order to build up a full picture of the "what" and more importantly the "why," we will first walk through a realistic example to gauge the type of problem generativity can solve. The latter half of this article will explain how to use the generativity pattern and then introduce a novel approach to creating unique "lifetime brands."

Let us take the role of a crate author about permutations. We want to investigate the [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_group#Composition_of_permutations–the_group_product) of permutations. This can be expressed nicely visually.

<PermutationExample />

The permutation `b` defines the remapping of the elements from permutation `a`. Pretty simple. Notice that permutation composition is only possible under the following three conditions:

1. `a` and `b` have the same length.
2. Each element from `a` and `b` must be less than or equal to the length.
3. Each element from `a` and `b` is unique.

Our library is general-purpose, so it is important to handle these error cases. Here is the simplest way to do that.

```rust
// We provide a `compose_into` function in case the caller already has
// a permutation preallocated. (This is good practice IMO).
pub fn compose_into(a: &[usize], b: &[usize], into: &mut [usize]) -> Result<(), &'static str> {
    if a.len() != b.len() || b.len() != into.len() {
        return Err("Permutations must have the same length");
    }
    let mut seen_b = vec![false; a.len()];
    let mut seen_a = vec![false; b.len()];
    for (into_value, &b_value) in into.iter_mut().zip(b) {
        if *seen_b
            .get(b_value)
            .ok_or("B contains an element greater than the length")?
        {
            return Err("B contains repeated elements");
        }
        seen_b[b_value] = true;

        let a_value = a[b_value];
        if *seen_a
            .get(a_value)
            .ok_or("A contains an element greater than the length")?
        {
            return Err("A contains repeated elements");
        }
        seen_a[a_value] = true;

        *into_value = a_value;
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

Good on you if this made you uneasy. Rust allows us to guarantee at the type level that `a` and `b` are valid permutations, using the [newtype](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/patterns/behavioural/newtype.html) design pattern.

```rust
pub struct Permutation(Box<[usize]>);

impl Permutation {
    pub fn from_mapping(mapping: Vec<usize>) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        // This function's implementation is omitted.
        validate_permutation(&mapping)?;
        Ok(Permutation(mapping.into_boxed_slice()))
    }

    pub fn compose_into(&self, b: &Self, into: &mut Self) -> Result<(), &'static str> {
        if self.0.len() != b.0.len() || b.0.len() != into.0.len() {
            return Err("Permutations must have the same length");
        }
        for (into_value, &b_value) in into.0.iter_mut().zip(&b.0) {
            // SAFETY: `b` is guaranteed to be a valid permutation
            // whose elements can index `self`
            *into_value = unsafe { *self.0.get_unchecked(b_value) };
        }
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn compose(&self, b: &Self) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        let mut result = Self(vec![0; self.0.len()].into_boxed_slice());
        self.compose_into(b, &mut result)?;
        Ok(result)
    }
}
```

The newtype pattern is more useful than just for getting around the orphan rule. We restrict construction of `Permutation` to the `from_mapping` method, which returns an error if the input is not a valid permutation. That means if we have an instance of `Permutation`, we don't have to worry about its mapping being potentially invalid before using it. Rustaceans describe type-level guarantees like this by saying an *invariant* of `Permutation` is that it represents a valid permutation. Composing two permutations upholds this invariant, so we expose `compose` to create a new `Permutation` from existing ones.

This code is a major improvement! It is simple, easy to use, and it provides reasonable errors. However, a closer examination reveals some problems:

- Every call to our composition function spends time performing a length check. Our example is simplistic so it happens to be cheap, but this type of check may require more expensive logic in a practical scenario.
- Returning a `Result` forces the caller to be prepared to handle the error variant. Library users might be able to guarantee that the length checks will pass, which would make the error handling more annoying than helpful.

Yes, these aren't *important* problems per se, but they are still inconveniences to be aware of.

We now want to extend our library to model a [permutation group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_group), or just a collection of a bunch of permutations. In a permutation group, every permutation can be written as a sequence of compositions of base permutations, which we will use to represent the entire collection. For example, the manipulations of the Rubik's Cube form a permutation group. Its base permutations which represent the entire permutation group are the six face rotations. Therefore, every possible state on the Rubik's cube can be reached from a combination of those face rotations. The illustrated turn is a permutation fifty-four elements long, because there are fifty-four stickers on a Rubik's cube[^cube].

<ContentImage src={stickeredCube} width="600" visualWidth="300" alt="The solved Rubik's cube" />

It follows that if you compose two permutations in a permutation group, the resulting permutation will also be a permutation in that group. The reasoning is not so relevant—take this at face value.

A reasonable data structure for permutation groups looks like this:

```rust
pub struct PermGroup {
    base_permutation_length: usize,
    base_permutations: Vec<Permutation>,
}

impl PermGroup {
    pub fn new(
        base_permutation_length: usize,
        base_permutation_mappings: Vec<Vec<usize>>,
    ) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        for mapping in &base_permutation_mappings {
            validate_permutation(mapping)?;
        }
        Ok(Self {
            base_permutation_length,
            base_permutations: base_permutation_mappings
                .into_iter()
                .map(Permutation::from_mapping)
                .collect::<Result<_, _>>()?,
        })
    }

    pub fn base_permutations(&self) -> &[Permutation] {
        &self.base_permutations
    }
}
```

Your *inner Ferris* awakens. With the annoyances of our last iteration freshly in memory, you ask yourself: can we perform the length check once during the creation of the permutation group, and avoid it entirely in our permutation composition function? Then, can we tweak our composition function to only operate on permutations from the same permutation group?

```rust
impl Permutation {
    pub(crate) fn from_mapping(mapping: Vec<usize>) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        validate_permutation(&mapping)?;
        Ok(Permutation(mapping.into_boxed_slice()))
    }

    pub fn compose_into(&self, b: &Permutation, into: &mut Permutation) {
        for i in 0..into.0.len() {
            unsafe {
                *into.0.get_unchecked_mut(i) = *self.0.get_unchecked(*b.0.get_unchecked(i));
            }
        }
    }

    pub fn compose(&self, b: &Permutation) -> Permutation {
        let mut result = Permutation(vec![0; self.0.len()].into_boxed_slice());
        self.compose_into(b, &mut result);
        result
    }
}
```

All of a sudden, we've opened up an unsafety hole! We implicitly assumed that the permutations to compose were from the same permutation group. This is not necessarily true—what if a library user composes two base permutations from different permutation groups? If the permutation lengths *don't* match, then `get_unchecked` will exhibit undefined behavior; this is clearly a problem! The intent of this operation is obviously nonsensical, but it does not change the fact that it is still our responsibility, as the crate author, that the safe functions we provide can never exhibit undefined behavior.

There is a more fundamental reason to care. An invariant of permutation composition within the same permutation group is membership; if the permutations to compose are in the same permutation group, the resulting permutation is also in that group. Even if the lengths of permutations from two different permutation groups *did* match, composing them could produce a permutation outside of either permutation group, which is a logic error. Mitigating this by checking permutation group membership every function call is a very expensive operation. This is an example of the "practical scenario" I mentioned beforehand.

We will analyze different approaches that ensure our library only permits permutation composition within the same permutation group. Each has their own trade-offs, but are all right answers for their own dedicated situations. They will also lay the groundwork to justify using the generativity pattern. All the code segments provided in this article can be found [here](https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/generativity-pattern-rs).

# The unsafe approach

The simplest solution is to mark `compose_into` unsafe.

```rust
impl Permutation {
    // ...

    /// # Safety
    ///
    /// `self`, `b`, and `into` must all be from the same permutation group.
    pub unsafe fn compose_into(&self, b: &Permutation, into: &mut Permutation) {
        for i in 0..into.0.len() {
            unsafe {
                *into.0.get_unchecked_mut(i) = *self.0.get_unchecked(*b.0.get_unchecked(i));
            }
        }
    }
    // ...
}
```

Although the extent of the undefined behavior with permutation composition is just the bounds checking, the goal of this approach is to enforce permutation group membership. Thus, the safety contract is made more restrictive to reflect this idea. This usage of unsafe is contentious. For permutations of the same length that violate the safety contract, composition is a logic error, but not technically unsafe. Sure, you might panic later on or get some other issue, but this alone will never violate the memory rules.

To play devil's advocate, since we only care about composition within the same permutation group, one may consider producing an invalid value from this type of permutation composition undefined behavior. With the safety contract's additional restriction, calling code no longer has to worry about handling this logic error, while additionally gaining the contextual benefit of this assumption. It is [generally agreed upon](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/should-i-use-unsafe-merely-to-encourage-users-to-maintain-invariants/27856) that unsafe should not be used for the sole purpose of maintaining validity invariants, primarily because code that is really unsafe won't be given the attention needed. Personally, I believe this use of unsafe is warranted. I encourage you to have your own opinion.

If you don't care about using unsafe—and there are valid reasons not to—then this might be what you want. That said, it's not always going to be this simple. What if you introduce a new trait, `ComposablePermutation`, that generalizes over different permutation representations? For example, the `PSHUFB` instruction can compose two permutations in a single clock cycle if they have less than sixteen elements.

```rust
pub trait ComposablePermutation: Clone {
    fn from_mapping(mapping: Vec<usize>) -> Result<Self, &'static str>;

    /// # Safety
    ///
    /// `self`, `b`, and `into` must all be from the same permutation group.
    unsafe fn compose_into(&self, b: &Self, into: &mut Self);

    /// # Safety
    ///
    /// `self` and `b` must both be from the same permutation group.
    unsafe fn compose(&self, b: &Self) -> Self {
        let mut result = self.clone();
        unsafe { self.compose_into(b, &mut result) };
        result
    }
}

impl ComposablePermutation for Permutation {
    // ...
}
```

The consequences of using unsafe begin to show. Because our generic `Permutation` implements `ComposablePermutation`, and we have shown that permutation composition from different permutation groups may cause undefined behavior, `compose_into` must be made unsafe at the trait level. Rust doesn't allow us to only make `Permutation`'s implementation unsafe; either all implementors must be made unsafe, or none at all. In a library *about* permutation composition, we have now forced our users to wrangle with unsafe for its most essential operation. Not just with `Permutation::compose_into`, but with all of their own implementations of `ComposablePermutation`.

*"That is completely unfair!"* You might say. *"This is a small edge condition I don't care about. I'm going to mark this trait method safe anyways."* Well, the Rust community generally has a zero-tolerance stance on undefined behavior; the last time someone wanted to mark an unsound method safe, [it didn't end very well](https://github.com/ogxd/gxhash/issues/82#issuecomment-2257578785).

# The atomic ID approach

The second approach is to validate input permutations *upfront* and use a private integer to uniquely associate them to a permutation group. This simplifies the test for permutation group membership to a cheap integer comparison. Code often speaks louder than words, so I have provided the full implementation of this approach. I really encourage you to internalize how this works and why this is sound.

```rust
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicU64, Ordering::Relaxed};

/// Permutation composition within the same permutation group
/// upholds the membership invariant; thus, callers can assume
/// `Permutation::compose` produces another permutation in this
/// permutation group.
pub struct PermGroup {
    base_permutation_length: usize,
    base_permutations: Vec<Permutation>,
    id: u64,
}

static ID: AtomicU64 = AtomicU64::new(0);

impl PermGroup {
    pub fn new(
        base_permutation_length: usize,
        base_permutation_mappings: Vec<Vec<usize>>,
    ) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        for mapping in &base_permutation_mappings {
            validate_permutation(mapping)?;
        }
        let id = ID.fetch_add(1, Relaxed);
        Ok(Self {
            base_permutation_length,
            base_permutations: base_permutation_mappings
                .into_iter()
                .map(|mapping| Permutation(mapping.into_boxed_slice(), id))
                .collect(),
            id,
        })
    }

    pub fn permutation_from_mapping(
        &self,
        mapping: Vec<usize>,
    ) -> Result<Permutation, &'static str> {
        // SAFETY: the resulting `Permutation` is only used for
        // composition if it is a member of this permutation
        // group.
        let permutation = unsafe { Permutation::from_mapping(mapping, self.id)? };
        // This function's implementation is omitted.
        validate_permutation_group_membership(&permutation, &self.base_permutations)?;
        Ok(permutation)
    }

    pub fn base_permutations(&self) -> &[Permutation] {
        &self.base_permutations
    }
}

pub struct Permutation(Box<[usize]>, u64);

impl Permutation {
    /// # Safety
    ///
    /// `Permutation`s with the same `id` must:
    /// - be valid permutations of the same length

    /// resulting `Permutation` is never used for composition.
    pub unsafe fn from_mapping(mapping: Vec<usize>, id: u64) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        validate_permutation(&mapping)?;
        Ok(Permutation(mapping.into_boxed_slice(), id))
    }

    /// See the note in `compose`.
    pub fn compose_into(&self, b: &Self, into: &mut Self) -> Result<(), &'static str> {
        if self.1 != b.1 || b.1 != into.1 {
            return Err("Permutations must come from the same permutation group");
        }
        for i in 0..into.0.len() {
            // SAFETY: `self`, `b`, and `into` have the same ID.
            // Therefore, they are valid permutations of the
            // same length that uphold any defined invariants
            // when composed.
            unsafe {
                *into.0.get_unchecked_mut(i) = *self.0.get_unchecked(*b.0.get_unchecked(i));
            }
        }
        Ok(())
    }

    /// Calling code can safely assume permutation composition
    /// upholds the invariants defined in `from_mapping`.
    pub fn compose(&self, b: &Self) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        let mut result = Permutation(vec![0; self.0.len()].into_boxed_slice(), self.1);
        self.compose_into(b, &mut result)?;
        Ok(result)
    }
}
```

THIS SECTION IS WIP

Let us briefly review how this works.

Since borrowck doesn't do interprocedural analysis, it
    // sees every call to this function produces values with some opaque
    // fresh lifetime and can't unify any of them.

You may be wondering about the point of `PermGroup::permutation_from_mapping`

There are a few significant remarks worth being made.

safe wrapper

Permutation takes Id instead of PermGroup, opting out of unsafe means performing validation inside from_mapping. The right answer depends on what you want. It doesn't even even need to be made public

No longer as contentious, the Rust standard library seems to [agree](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.from_utf8_unchecked).

# The generativity approach

THIS SECTION IS WIP

generativity is a complicated solution to throw at a problem, this is the reason I used to justify it: compile-time brands

The extra effort is minimal

The fundamental problem is that the invariant of `Permutation` guarantees it is a valid permutation, but not that it is associated with a specific `PermGroup`.

'id is contagious

What would really be nice is an *infallible* composition operation—one that we can guarantee is correct at the type level.

```rust
use generativity::{Guard, Id};

/// Permutation composition within the same permutation group
/// upholds the membership invariant; thus, callers can assume
/// `Permutation::compose` produces another permutation in this
/// permutation group.
pub struct PermGroup<'id> {
    base_permutation_length: usize,
    base_permutations: Vec<Permutation<'id>>,
    id: Id<'id>,
}

impl<'id> PermGroup<'id> {
    pub fn new(
        base_permutation_length: usize,
        base_permutation_mappings: Vec<Vec<usize>>,
        guard: Guard<'id>,
    ) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        for mapping in &base_permutation_mappings {
            validate_permutation(mapping)?;
        }
        let id = guard.into();
        Ok(Self {
            base_permutation_length,
            base_permutations: base_permutation_mappings
                .into_iter()
                .map(|mapping| Permutation(mapping.into_boxed_slice(), id))
                .collect()?,
            id,
        })
    }

    pub fn permutation_from_mapping(
        &self,
        mapping: Vec<usize>,
    ) -> Result<Permutation<'id>, &'static str> {
        // SAFETY: the resulting `Permutation` is only used for
        // composition if it is a member of this permutation
        // group.
        let permutation = unsafe { Permutation::from_mapping(mapping, self.id)? };
        validate_permutation_group_membership(&permutation, &self.base_permutations)?;
        Ok(permutation)
    }

    pub fn base_permutations(&self) -> &[Permutation<'id>] {
        &self.base_permutations
    }
}

pub struct Permutation<'id>(Box<[usize]>, Id<'id>);

impl<'id> Permutation<'id> {

    pub unsafe fn from_mapping(mapping: Vec<usize>, id: Id<'id>) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        validate_permutation(&mapping)?;
        Ok(Self(mapping.into_boxed_slice(), id))
    }

    /// See the note in `compose`.
    pub fn compose_into(&self, b: &Self, into: &mut Self) {
        for i in 0..into.0.len() {
            // SAFETY: `self`, `b`, and `into` have the same
            // lifetime brand. Therefore, they are valid
            // permutations of the same length that uphold any
            // defined invariants when composed.
            unsafe {
                *into.0.get_unchecked_mut(i) = *self.0.get_unchecked(*b.0.get_unchecked(i));
            }
        }
    }

    /// Calling code can safely assume permutation composition
    /// upholds the invariants defined in `from_mapping`.
    pub fn compose(&self, b: &Self) -> Self {
        let mut result = Permutation(vec![0; self.0.len()].into_boxed_slice(), self.1);
        self.compose_into(b, &mut result);
        result
    }
}
```

"Generativity" as it exists in Rust allows us a sort of very limited form of dependent typing: each time a closure is executed at runtime, a brand new type (in this case, a Rust lifetime) is generated that cannot be unified with any other generated instance.

It's useful anytime you want to guarantee that two values come from or refer to the same source. Then give a list of bullet points that all need to be true to use generativity

Lifetimes in Rust are usually used to track the scopes during which mutable and
shared references are valid, but in the case of GhostCell and GhostToken, the brand lifetime 'id
is not actually used as a lifetime rather, it merely serves as a static representative of the collection
to which all the nodes of type `GhostCell<'id, _>` belong.

This may be old news to some, `BrandedVec` & GhostCell

similarities with GhostCell, invariant + no op type only

similar to stack tokens https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2022/11/23/stack-tokens/

"This implies that we, as the developer of the library, have
the obligation to prove that such accesses are actually safe under all possible interactions with well-typed clients."

Does not use a closure

[Aria Desires' Master's thesis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gankro/thesis/master/thesis.pdf)
"Hacking Generativity into Rust", right before she says "we really don't recommend doing this".

<Aside>

As this StackOverflow user [points out](https://stackoverflow.com/a/76876800), you can achieve something similar using an anonymous "invariant token" unit struct and a macro to create the permutation group. Successive calls to this macro will create permutation groups with a unique brand.

```rust
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! new_perm_group {
    ($len:expr, $mappings:expr) => {{
        let len = $len;
        let mappings = $mappings;
        struct InvariantToken;
        // SAFETY: private API, only used in this macro.
        unsafe {
            $crate::PermGroup::<InvariantToken>::new(len, mappings)
        }
    }};
}
```

```rust
let first_perm_group = new_perm_group!(4, vec![vec![1, 2, 0, 3]]).unwrap();
let second_perm_group = new_perm_group!(3, vec![vec![2, 0, 1]]).unwrap();
let first_perm = &first_perm_group.base_permutations()[0];
let second_perm = &second_perm_group.base_permutations()[0];

first_perm.compose(second_perm); // Compile error!
```

The flaw is quite subtle. The [implementation](https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/generativity-pattern-rs/blob/main/src/6-unsound-token.rs) creates a token per-*call* instead of per-*owner*. Every expression results in a particular type; if the same macro is ran more than once, it will produce the same type. This can be exploited to give multiple owners the same brand.

```rust
let first = (4, vec![vec![1, 2, 0, 3]]);
let second = (3, vec![vec![2, 0, 1]]);

let mut perm_groups = vec![];
for (len, mappings) in [first, second] {
    perm_groups.push(new_perm_group!(len, mappings).unwrap());
}
let first_perm = &perm_groups[0].base_permutations()[0];
let second_perm = &perm_groups[1].base_permutations()[0];

first_perm.compose(second_perm); // No compile error, UB!

We have just invoked undefined behavior from safe user-facing code. This is unsound without question. A possible remedy is to toggle a static `AtomicBool` inside the macro and use it to panic at runtime if the same macro is reinvoked. This only creates a strictly worse version of `generativity`. There is no point in endorsing this approach.

This offers another perspective as to why `generativity`'s invariant lifetimes cannot escape their scope. If this were possible, we would have the exact same unsoundness problem.

# How does generativity work?

Generativity is a limited system that can solve some of the problems usually re-served for dependent typing.

Those familiar with generativity and type systems may see that
we are ultimately just applying an age-old trick: universal types and
functions can be combined to construct existential types. In this case
where `F: for<'id> FnOnce(Array<'arr, 'id>)` is declaring that the
function F is universal over all lifetimes that can be chosen for id. The
body of any function that satisfies this signature must work with any
id it receives opaquely. In effect, it knows that there exists a lifetime,
and nothing else.

I changed just [nine lines](https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/generativity-pattern-rs/commit/806c8bef89b1d0c0621db42c130856bf33fffb9f) of code from [GhostCell's implementation](https://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt/ghostcell/paper.pdf) of `BrandedVec` to simplify the API using generativity

before:

```rust
let vec1: Vec<u8> = vec![10, 11];
let vec2: Vec<u8> = vec![20, 21];

BrandedVec::new(vec1, move |mut bvec1: BrandedVec<u8>| {
    bvec1.push(12);
    let i1 = bvec1.push(13);
    let _idx = bvec1.get_index(0).unwrap();
    BrandedVec::new(vec2, move |mut bvec2: BrandedVec<u8>| {
        let i2 = bvec2.push(22);
        println!("{:?}", bvec2.get(i2)); // No bound check! Prints 22
        *bvec2.get_mut(i2) -= 1; // No bound check!
        println!("{:?}", bvec2.get(i2)); // Prints 21
        println!("{:?}", bvec1.get(i1)); // Prints 13
        // rejected: i1 is not an index of bvec2
        // println!("{:?}", bvec2.get(i1));
    });
});
```

after:

```rust
let vec1: Vec<u8> = vec![10, 11];
let vec2: Vec<u8> = vec![20, 21];

let guard1 = make_guard!();
let mut bvec1 = BrandedVec::new(vec1, guard1);
bvec1.push(12);
let i1 = bvec1.push(13);
let _idx = bvec1.get_index(0).unwrap();

let guard2 = make_guard!();
let mut bvec2 = BrandedVec::new(vec2, guard2);
let i2 = bvec2.push(22);
println!("{:?}", bvec2.get(i2)); // No bound check! Prints 22
*bvec2.get_mut(i2) -= 1; // No bound check!
println!("{:?}", bvec2.get(i2)); // Prints 21
println!("{:?}", bvec1.get(i1)); // Prints 13
// rejected: i1 is not an index of bvec2
// println!("{:?}", bvec2.get(i1));
```

there is a tiny movement to make it a bit more ergonomic https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/135806

the make_guard!() macro creates an `Id<'id>` but also an `&'id Id<'id>` in the same scope
this forces the drop time of `'id` to be "in between" `&'id Id<'id>` and `Id<'id>`
since they are both in the same scope this "in between" area has no actual realization in the source code
This creates an invariant lifetime `'id` here, and ties it to the borrow of tag, which must live until the end of the current scope. i.e., we must have `&'id Id<'id>` at the make_guard! location, and have `&'id Id<'id>` at the drop location for make_guard!, where `'id` is an invariant lifetime
tag and _guard together guarantee that `'id` lives to a drop point that is different from the drop point of any other make_guard! created lifetime, so unifying the two lifetimes would be incorrect. It's also very important that neither tag nor _guard are leaked from our protected hygiene, as if they could be manipulated, the drop timing could potentially be changed.
no lifetime can unify with `'id` unless it can end in the same region.

Why the `make_guard!(guard)` macro? super let

# Benchmarks

No comparison would be complete without a benchmark. Yes, the point of the generativity pattern is more fundamental than just speed, but I know what people want. I statically generated two random length-fifteen permutations and wrote a Criterion benchmark for all five approaches to permutation composition.

| Benchmark Name | Time (ns) |
| -------------- | --------- |
| 1-slice        | 14.805    |
| 2-newtype      | 4.257     |
| 4-atomic-id    | 3.940     |
| 5-generativity | 3.604     |
| 3-unsafe-trait | 3.602     |

Empirically, this validates all of my observations. The naive `1-slice` is the slowest because it checks every permutation for complete validity during composition. `2-newtype` removes most of the validation overhead. Admittedly this is good enough; you would only care about the other solutions if you could prove that permutation composition was the bottleneck. `4-atomic-id` replaces the validation with a single integer comparison, making it marginally faster. Finally, `5-generativity` and `3-unsafe-trait` emerge the fastest because they avoid validation entirely. The important difference: `3-unsafe-trait` marks permutation composition unsafe while `5-generativity` does not.

# Closing thoughts

I hope your found our little survey of design patterns interesting

This concludes the first technical write-up on my blog. I came into this topic with a surface level understanding of what `generativity` is and how it works. I was not expecting this to take two weeks of research and writing, and I was entirely unprepared for how interesting the full story would be. My posts only get more fun to write.

Thank you for reading this far. Until next time!

[^cube]: The center stickers don't actually move, and thus can be ignored, so the illustrated turn is traditionally simplified to a permutation forty-eight elements long.
