# Background

The *generativity pattern* in Rust is a combination of [typestate](https://cliffle.com/blog/rust-typestate/) and [GhostCell](https://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt/ghostcell/), techniques that eliminate runtime overhead through compile-time safety guarantees. This pattern is not commonplace; its usage warrants a specific set of circumstances. Aside from thinly spread (but admittedly well-written) academic literature[^literature], I haven't a found an accessible analysis of this pattern online. In order to build up a full picture of the "what" and more importantly the "why," we will first walk through a realistic example to gauge the type of problem generativity can solve. The latter half of this article will explain how to use the generativity pattern and then introduce a novel approach to creating lifetime brands.

[^literature]: Yes, I will eventually get to them. You just need to keep reading.

Let us take the role of a crate author about permutations. We want to investigate the [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_group#Composition_of_permutations–the_group_product) of permutations. This can be expressed nicely visually.

<PermutationExample />

The permutation `b` defines the remapping of the elements from permutation `a`. Pretty simple. Notice that permutation composition is only possible under the following three conditions:

1. `a` and `b` must have the same length.
2. Every element from `a` and `b` must be less than or equal to the length.
3. Every element from `a` and `b` must be unique.

Our library is general-purpose, so it is important to handle these error cases. Here is the simplest way to do that.

```rust
/// We provide a `compose_into` function in case the caller already
/// has a permutation preallocated. (This is good practice IMO).
pub fn compose_into(a: &[usize], b: &[usize], into: &mut [usize]) -> Result<(), &'static str> {
    if a.len() != b.len() || b.len() != into.len() {
        return Err("Permutations must have the same length");
    }
    let mut seen_b = vec![false; a.len()];
    let mut seen_a = vec![false; b.len()];
    for (into_value, &b_value) in into.iter_mut().zip(b) {
        if *seen_b
            .get(b_value)
            .ok_or("B contains an element greater than the length")?
        {
            return Err("B contains repeated elements");
        }
        seen_b[b_value] = true;

        let a_value = a[b_value];
        if *seen_a
            .get(a_value)
            .ok_or("A contains an element greater than the length")?
        {
            return Err("A contains repeated elements");
        }
        seen_a[a_value] = true;

        *into_value = a_value;
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

Good on you if this made you uneasy. Rust allows us to guarantee at the type level that `a` and `b` are valid permutations, using the [newtype](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/patterns/behavioural/newtype.html) design pattern.

```rust
pub struct Permutation(Box<[usize]>);

impl Permutation {
    pub fn from_mapping(mapping: Vec<usize>) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        // This function errors if `mapping` is an invalid
        // permutation or its length does not match the second
        // argument. The implementation is ommitted.
        validate_permutation(&mapping, mapping.len())?;
        Ok(Self(mapping.into_boxed_slice()))
    }

    pub fn compose_into(&self, b: &Self, into: &mut Self) -> Result<(), &'static str> {
        if self.0.len() != b.0.len() || b.0.len() != into.0.len() {
            return Err("Permutations must have the same length");
        }
        for (into_value, &b_value) in into.0.iter_mut().zip(&b.0) {
            // SAFETY: `b` is guaranteed to be a valid permutation
            // whose elements can index `self`
            *into_value = unsafe { *self.0.get_unchecked(b_value) };
        }
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn compose(&self, b: &Self) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        let mut result = Self(vec![0; self.0.len()].into_boxed_slice());
        self.compose_into(b, &mut result)?;
        Ok(result)
    }
}
```

The newtype pattern is more useful than just for getting around the [orphan rule](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/implementations.html#r-items.impl.trait.orphan-rule). We restrict construction of `Permutation` to `Permutation::from_mapping`, which returns an error if the input is not a valid permutation. That means if we have an instance of `Permutation`, we don't have to worry about its mapping being potentially invalid, reducing the validation overhead during permutation composition to a length check. Rustaceans describe type-level guarantees like this by saying an *invariant* of `Permutation` is that it represents a valid permutation. Composing two permutations upholds this invariant, so we expose `Permutation::compose` to create a new `Permutation` from existing ones.

This code is a major improvement! It is simple, easy to use, and it provides reasonable errors. However, a closer examination reveals some problems:

- Every call to our composition function spends time performing a length check. Our example is simplistic so it happens to be cheap, but this type of check may require more expensive logic in a practical scenario.
- Returning a `Result` forces the caller to be prepared to handle the error variant. Library users might be able to guarantee that the length checks will pass, which would make the error handling more annoying than helpful.

Yes, these aren't *important* problems per se, but they are still inconveniences to be aware of.

We now want to extend our library to model a [permutation group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_group), or just a collection of a bunch of permutations. In a permutation group, every permutation can be written as a sequence of compositions of base permutations, which we will use to represent the entire collection. For example, the manipulations of the Rubik's Cube form a permutation group. Its base permutations which represent the entire permutation group are the six face rotations. Therefore, every possible state on the Rubik's cube can be reached from a combination of those face rotations.

The illustrated turn is a permutation fifty-four elements long, because there are fifty-four stickers on a Rubik's cube[^cube].

[^cube]: The center stickers don't actually move, and thus can be ignored, so the illustrated turn is traditionally simplified to a permutation forty-eight elements long.

<ContentImage src={stickeredCube} width="600" visualWidth="300" alt="The solved Rubik's cube" />

It follows that if you compose two permutations in a permutation group, the resulting permutation will also be a permutation in that group. You may reason about this fact from the information so far provided, but it is not relevant. Take this at face value.

A reasonable data structure for permutation groups looks like this:

```rust
pub struct PermGroup {
    base_permutation_length: usize,
    base_permutations: Vec<Permutation>,
}

impl PermGroup {
    pub fn new(
        base_permutation_length: usize,
        base_permutation_mappings: Vec<Vec<usize>>,
    ) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        for mapping in &base_permutation_mappings {
            validate_permutation(mapping, base_permutation_length)?;
        }
        Ok(Self {
            base_permutation_length,
            base_permutations: base_permutation_mappings
                .into_iter()
                .map(Permutation::from_mapping)
                .collect::<Result<_, _>>()?,
        })
    }

    pub fn base_permutations(&self) -> &[Permutation] {
        &self.base_permutations
    }
}
```

Your *inner Ferris* awakens. With the annoyances of our last iteration freshly in memory, you ask yourself: can we perform that length check once during the creation of the permutation group, and avoid it entirely in our permutation composition function? Then, can we tweak our composition function to only operate on permutations from the same permutation group?

```rust
impl Permutation {
    pub(crate) fn from_mapping(mapping: Vec<usize>) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        validate_permutation(&mapping, mapping.len())?;
        Ok(Self(mapping.into_boxed_slice()))
    }

    pub fn compose_into(&self, b: &Permutation, into: &mut Permutation) {
        for i in 0..into.0.len() {
            // SAFETY: ... ?
            unsafe {
                *into.0.get_unchecked_mut(i) = *self.0.get_unchecked(*b.0.get_unchecked(i));
            }
        }
    }

    pub fn compose(&self, b: &Permutation) -> Permutation {
        let mut result = Self(vec![0; self.0.len()].into_boxed_slice());
        self.compose_into(b, &mut result);
        result
    }
}
```

All of a sudden, we've opened up an unsafety hole—notice the implementation of `Permutation::compose_into`! We implicitly assumed that the permutations to compose were from the same permutation group. This is not necessarily true: what if a library user composes two base permutations from different permutation groups? If the permutation lengths *don't* match, then `get_unchecked` will exhibit undefined behavior; this is clearly a problem! The intent of this operation is obviously nonsensical, but it does not change the fact that it is still our responsibility, as the crate author, that the safe functions we provide can never exhibit undefined behavior.

There is a more fundamental reason to care. An invariant of permutation composition within the same permutation group is membership; if the permutations to compose are in the same permutation group, the resulting permutation is also in that group. Even if the lengths of permutations from two different permutation groups *did* match, composing them could produce a permutation outside of either group, which is a logic error. Mitigating this by checking permutation group membership every function call is a very expensive operation. This is an example of the "practical scenario" mentioned beforehand.

The newtype pattern alone is not powerful enough to prevent this error. We will analyze different approaches that ensure our library only permits permutation composition within the same permutation group. Each has their own trade-offs, but are all right answers for their own dedicated situations. They will also lay the groundwork to justify using the generativity pattern. All the code segments provided in this article can be found [here](https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/generativity-pattern-rs).

# The unsafe approach

The simplest solution is to mark `Permutation::compose_into` and `Permutation::compose` unsafe.

```rust
/// # Safety
///
/// `self`, `b`, and `into` must all be from the same
/// permutation group.
pub unsafe fn compose_into(&self, b: &Permutation, into: &mut Permutation) {
    for i in 0..into.0.len() {
        // SAFETY: permutations within the same group can be
        // composed.
        unsafe {
            *into.0.get_unchecked_mut(i) = *self.0.get_unchecked(*b.0.get_unchecked(i));
        }
    }
}
```

Although the extent of the undefined behavior with permutation composition is just the bounds checking, the goal of this approach is to enforce permutation group membership. Thus, the above safety contract is made more restrictive to reflect this idea. The usage of unsafe to maintain a validity invariant is contentious. Permutation composition of the same length within different permutation groups is a logic error, and it violates the safety contract, but is not technically unsafe. Sure, you might panic later on or get some other issue, but this alone will never exhibit undefined behavior.

To play devil's advocate, since we only care about composition within the same permutation group, one may consider producing an invalid value from this type of permutation composition undefined behavior. With the safety contract's additional restriction, calling code no longer has to worry about handling this logic error, while additionally gaining the contextual benefit of this assumption. Personally, I believe this use of unsafe is warranted; at the end of the day, the safety contract does still prevent undefined behavior. I encourage you to [have your own opinion](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/should-i-use-unsafe-merely-to-encourage-users-to-maintain-invariants/27856).

If you don't care about using unsafe—and there are valid reasons not to—then this might be what you want. That said, it's not always going to be this simple. What if you introduce a new trait, `ComposablePermutation`, that generalizes over different permutation representations? For example, the `PSHUFB` instruction can compose two permutations in a single clock cycle if they have less than sixteen elements.

```rust
pub trait ComposablePermutation: Clone {
    fn from_mapping(mapping: Vec<usize>) -> Result<Self, &'static str>;

    /// # Safety
    ///
    /// `self`, `b`, and `into` must all be from the same
    // permutation group.
    unsafe fn compose_into(&self, b: &Self, into: &mut Self);

    /// # Safety
    ///
    /// `self` and `b` must both be from the same permutation
    // group.
    unsafe fn compose(&self, b: &Self) -> Self {
        let mut result = self.clone();
        // SAFETY: `self`, `b`, and `result` are all from the
        // same permutation group.
        unsafe { self.compose_into(b, &mut result) };
        result
    }
}

impl ComposablePermutation for Permutation {
    // ...
}
```

The consequences of using unsafe begin to show. Because our generic `Permutation` implements `ComposablePermutation`, and we have shown that permutation composition from different permutation groups may cause undefined behavior, `Permutation::compose_into` must be made unsafe at the trait level. Rust doesn't allow us to only make `Permutation`'s implementation unsafe; either all implementors must be made unsafe, or none at all. In a library *about* permutation composition, we have now forced our users to wrangle with unsafe for its most essential operation. Not just with `Permutation::compose_into`, but with all of their own implementations of `ComposablePermutation`.

*"That is completely unfair!"* You might say. *"This is a small edge condition I don't care about. I'm going to mark this trait method safe anyways."* Well, the Rust community generally has a zero-tolerance stance on undefined behavior; the last time someone wanted to mark an unsound method safe, [it didn't end very well](https://github.com/ogxd/gxhash/issues/82#issuecomment-2257578785).

# The atomic ID approach

The second approach is to validate our base permutations *upfront* and use a private integer to associate them to a unique permutation group. This simplifies the test for permutation group membership to a cheap integer comparison. This section is implementation-heavy, but internalizing how it works will be crucial to understanding the generativity approach.

```rust
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicU64, Ordering::Relaxed};

pub struct PermGroup {
    base_permutation_length: usize,
    base_permutations: Vec<Permutation>,
    id: u64,
}

static ID: AtomicU64 = AtomicU64::new(0);

impl PermGroup {
    pub fn new(
        base_permutation_length: usize,
        base_permutation_mappings: Vec<Vec<usize>>,
    ) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        for mapping in &base_permutation_mappings {
            validate_permutation(mapping, base_permutation_length)?;
        }
        let id = ID.fetch_add(1, Relaxed);
        Ok(Self {
            base_permutation_length,
            base_permutations: base_permutation_mappings
                .into_iter()
                .map(|mapping| Permutation(mapping.into_boxed_slice(), id))
                .collect(),
            id,
        })
    }

    pub fn base_permutations(&self) -> &[Permutation] {
        &self.base_permutations
    }
}
```

Compared to the unsafe approach, the implementation of `PermGroup` does not change much. As before, we check that all mappings from `base_permutation_mappings` are valid permutations of the same length before creating a new `PermGroup`. This time, we utilize a global `AtomicU64` to identify the permutations in a unique permutation group, passing it as an integer to `Permutation`. The integer is guaranteed to be unique among different permutation groups because we properly increment the identifier every call to `PermGroup::new`.

```rust
pub struct Permutation(Box<[usize]>, u64);

impl Permutation {
    pub fn from_mapping_and_group(
        mapping: Vec<usize>,
        group: &PermGroup,
    ) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        validate_permutation(&mapping, group.base_permutation_length)?;
        let permutation = Self(mapping.into_boxed_slice(), group.id);
        validate_permutation_group_membership(&permutation, &group.base_permutations)?;
        Ok(permutation)
    }

    pub fn compose_into(&self, b: &Self, into: &mut Self) -> Result<(), &'static str> {
        if self.1 != b.1 || b.1 != into.1 {
            return Err("Permutations must come from the same permutation group");
        }
        for i in 0..into.0.len() {
            // SAFETY: `self`, `b`, and `into` have the same ID.
            // Therefore, they are members of the same group and
            // can be composed.
            unsafe {
                *into.0.get_unchecked_mut(i) = *self.0.get_unchecked(*b.0.get_unchecked(i));
            }
        }
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn compose(&self, b: &Self) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        let mut result = Self(vec![0; self.0.len()].into_boxed_slice(), self.1);
        self.compose_into(b, &mut result)?;
        Ok(result)
    }
}
```

Creating a new `Permutation` now requires a mapping and a `PermGroup` reference. Once the mapping is verified as both a valid permutation and a member of that permutation group, only then is a new `Permutation` created with that `PermGroup`'s identifier, as a "token" of its membership. We can no longer create `Permutation`s willy-nilly from just a mapping because that would offer no guarantees about the uniqueness of its identifier.

The fruits of our labor are rewarded in `Permutation::compose_into`. The expensive permutation group membership test is performed exclusively during `Permutation`'s creation. When two permutations are composed, those same "tokens" are used to cheaply verify membership within the same permutation group. Hence, callers can safely assume permutation composition produces another permutation in the same permutation group without compromising efficiency.

It is worth taking a step back to reflect. Although this solution might be appreciated in academia, some programmers are likely to consider it over-engineered. I offer no rebuttal: indeed, you would need a good reason to care this much. However, if your interest is piqued, what would really be nice is an *infallible* yet *zero-cost* permutation composition operation—one that is guaranteed to be valid at compile-time and as fast as the unsafe approach. If you're willing to go a small step farther, we arrive at...

# The generativity approach

The big reveal: the generativity approach is equivalent to the atomic ID approach, except everything is done at compile-time. Generativity solves the fundamental problem thus far: the invariant of `Permutation` guarantees it is a valid permutation, but not that it is associated with a specific `PermGroup`.

Existing literature achieves generativity by sacrificing ergonomics and readability. They require wrapping all code in (often deeply nested) closures, warding off much of their interest in practice. We will spend the rest of this article examining Crystal Durham's [`generativity`](https://crates.io/crates/generativity) crate, which utilizes a novel and highly experimental technique to achieve generativity without needing a closure. Later, we will prove that the `generativity` crate is a zero-cost compile-time abstraction.

*(Subtle-but-no-so-subtle foreshadowing: we will explore my own improvement to this technique in the next section)*

```rust
use generativity::{Guard, Id, make_guard}

fn main() {
    // Create a variable `guard` of type `Guard<'_>`
    make_guard!(guard);
    // Consume that `guard` into an `Id<'_>`
    let id: Id<'_> = guard.into();
}
```

`generativity` publicizes three things: `Guard`, `Id`, and `make_guard`. Invoking the `make_guard` macro creates a `Guard<'_>` with a let binding, an identifier that carries a guaranteed unique lifetime. `Id<'_>` is similar to `Guard<'_>` except that it implements `Copy` and `Clone` while the latter does not. So, to create distributable copies of this identifier, you must consume a `Guard<'_>` into an `Id<'_>` using its `From` implementation. The guaranteed unique lifetime is not actually used as a lifetime in the usual sense. It exists solely to create unique type for anything that carries it. In terms of what `generativity` has to offer, this is all.

Let us prove `generativity`'s equivalence to the atomic ID approach:

- In the atomic ID approach, unique integer identifiers are created à la `ID.fetch_add(1, Relaxed)`. This directly parallels `make_guard!(guard)`, which creates a unique `Guard<'_>` identifier.
- The unique integer identifier is then stored inside a primitive `u64`. This implements `Copy`, so it is distributed among the input base permutations and used to associate each one with the permutation group. Similarly, `Id<'_>` serves this same purpose.

As such, the body of `PermGroup::new` hardly changes at all.

```rust
pub struct PermGroup { // [!code --]
pub struct PermGroup<'id> { // [!code ++]
    base_permutation_length: usize,
    base_permutations: Vec<Permutation>,
    id: u64, // [!code --]
    id: Id<'id> // [!code ++]
}
```

```rust
pub fn new(
    base_permutation_length: usize,
    base_permutation_mappings: Vec<Vec<usize>>,
    guard: Guard<'id>, // [!code ++]
) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
    for mapping in &base_permutation_mappings {
        validate_permutation(mapping, base_permutation_length)?;
    }
    let id = ID.fetch_add(1, Relaxed); // [!code --]
    let id = guard.into(); // [!code ++]
    Ok(Self {
        base_permutation_length,
        base_permutations: base_permutation_mappings
            .into_iter()
            .map(|mapping| Permutation(mapping.into_boxed_slice(), id))
            .collect(),
        id,
    })
}
```

Why is `guard` passed as an argument, and why isn't `make_guard` creating it within the function body? This reveals `generativity`'s implementation caveat: a `Guard<'_>` can never escape the scope it was defined in. Think of creating a `Guard<'_>` as creating a reference to a local variable: no matter what, it is only valid inside of its enclosing scope.

So, instantiating two different permutation groups, for example, looks like this:

```rust
make_guard!(guard1);
make_guard!(guard2);
let first = PermGroup::new(..., guard1);
let second = PermGroup::new(..., guard2);
// rejected: `guard1` used after move
// let third = PermGroup::new(..., guard1);
```

This should also highlight the purpose of `Guard<'_>` when `Id<'_>` already exists. If `PermGroup::new` accepted an `Id<'_>`, two different permutation groups could be assigned the same `Id<'_>` because it implements `Copy`.

Okay, this is all fine and dandy, but how does this help improve permutation composition?

```rust
pub struct Permutation(Box<[usize]>, u64); // [!code --]
pub struct Permutation<'id>(Box<[usize]>, Id<'id>); // [!code ++]
```

Recall that every `Id<'_>` carries a guaranteed unique lifetime among different permutation groups. By combining `Permutation` with `Id<'_>` and a lifetime parameter, we create *distinct* `Permutation<'id>` types for the permutations in each permutation group. However, our permutation composition function takes in the *same* type `Self` for all arguments—it follows that `Permutation<'id>`s from different permutation groups cannot be composed as they are not the same type. This is the essence of the generativity pattern, enforced at compile-time.

Behold: a permutation composition function that is unchecked, infallible, and safe. The full implementation is [here](https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/generativity-pattern-rs/blob/main/src/5-generativity.rs).

```rust
pub fn compose_into(&self, b: &Self, into: &mut Self) -> Result<(), &'static str> { // [!code --]
    if self.1 != b.1 || b.1 != into.1 { // [!code --]
        return Err("Permutations must come from the same permutation group"); // [!code --]
    } // [!code --]
pub fn compose_into(&self, b: &Self, into: &mut Self) { // [!code ++]
    for i in 0..into.0.len() {
        // SAFETY: `self`, `b`, and `into` are members of the
        // same group and can be composed.
        unsafe {
            *into.0.get_unchecked_mut(i) = *self.0.get_unchecked(*b.0.get_unchecked(i));
        }
    }
    Ok(()) // [!code --]
}
```

It would be irresponsible for me to advertise the `generativity` crate as a perfect solution barring its implementation caveat. Yes, the implementation caveat is its only functional limitation, but there are some developer experience problems to consider.

- Although there's only a single line marked unsafe in our `Permutation<'id>` example, its soundness is now much harder to justify. It is on the developer to prove that `'id` uniquely associates permutations to their permutation group; any mishandling could easily make the whole thing unsound (i.e. if `PermGroup::new` took an `Id<'id>` instead of a `Guard<'id>`).
- The `'id` lifetime, like all other lifetimes, is pervasive. Data structures that wish to store `Guard<'_>` or `Id<'_>`, or any other data structure that stores `Guard<'_>` or `Id<'_>`, must have a lifetime annotation. But `make_guard` is typically invoked at the outermost scope, and will likely have to be passed through many types, so the number of lifetime annotations is amplified.
- The compiler errors from misusing `generativity` are confusing, even when you know how it internally works.
- Some APIs require types to satisfy `'static`, often resulting in inconvenient workarounds. For example, the closure passed to `thread::spawn` must satisfy `'static`, making it impossible to return a `Permutation<'id>`. The standard library offers `thread::scope` as a band-aid to make this possible, but this does not change the fact that additional complexity is often required.

The atomic ID approach shares only the first problem. Given your use case, it might be what you want.

Notice how different instances of `Permutation<'id>` masquerade as separate types even though they have the same underlying data representation. In Rust, `'id` is known as a *branded lifetime*, or more generally, a *type brand*. The first principles of type branding date back at least to the work of John Launchbury and Simon Peyton Jones on the [ST monad in Haskell](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01018827) (section 2.5.2) in 1995. Aria Desires' [master's thesis](https://github.com/Gankra/thesis/blob/master/thesis.pdf) (section 6.3) brought this into the context of Rust in 2015, coining lifetime branding in Rust with the term "generativity." The more recent [GhostCell paper](https://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt/ghostcell/) by Joshua Yanovski and others utilized generativity to present interior mutability as a zero-cost abstraction in 2021.

This segways into an important point. The fundamental purpose of the generativity pattern is not necessarily to improve performance, but to statically require that individual values come from or refer to the same source when newtyping isn't enough. The performance benefits are a symptom of this requirement. I like to informally think of it as stronger form of ownership.

Aria Desires' master's thesis explores this idea with a simple example, `BrandedVec`. When the `i`th element of a vector `vec` is accessed through `&vec[i]`, a runtime check is performed to see if `i` is in bounds. If not, then the program will panic. However, in many situations we know that the indices are always in bounds; one such case regards the append-only vector. All elements pushed to this type of vector are forever valid. Leveraging this fact, the push operation returns the index of the pushed element so it can later be used to soundly perform unchecked indexing.

If we wanted to mark the unchecked indexing operation safe, this returned index can't be an ordinary `usize`. Bad actors may provide their own `usize` instead of one returned from the push operation. This returned index can't be a newtyped `usize` either. The problem with this is a microcosm of the problem with our initial `Permutation` example: different indices from different append-only vectors may be used to unsoundly index one another. To make our accesses safe, the solution is to lifetime brand the returned indices to statically associate them with `vec`—the generativity pattern.

As hinted to beforehand, generativity has traditionally only been achieved through the use of a closure. The following example from the GhostCell paper demonstrates its inspired [adaption](https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/FP/ghostcell/-/blob/master/ghostcell/examples/branded_vec.rs) of `BrandedVec`. Each `BrandedVec` created from a `Vec` receives its own lifetime brand within that closure[^brandedvec].

[^brandedvec]: Rust doesn't have [rank-2 polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism#Higher-rank_polymorphism), so we need to replicate it using a closure with a [Higher-Rank Trait Bound](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/hrtb.html). The type signature of the closure passed to `BrandedVec::new` is `inner: impl for<'id> FnOnce(BrandedVec<'id, T>) -> R`. With this bound, every call to `inner` must be prepared to handle an argument with any possible lifetime. Within a single function the compiler has perfect information, but calling `inner` inside `BrandedVec::new` tricks the borrow checker. Since it doesn't (and will likely never) do interprocedural analysis, it conservatively sees every call to `inner` as producing an opaque lifetime that can't unified with any other. To avoid any relation with an existing lifetime, a fresh new lifetime is statically generated for every call to `BrandedVec::new`, our lifetime brand for `BrandedVec<'id, T>`. This is just a brief overview of a well-investigated topic. Repeating for convenience, further reading is encouraged [here](https://github.com/Gankra/thesis/blob/master/thesis.pdf) (section 6.3) and [here](https://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt/ghostcell/) (section 2.2.1).

```rust
let vec1: Vec<u8> = vec![10, 11];
let vec2: Vec<u8> = vec![20, 21];

BrandedVec::new(vec1, move |mut bvec1: BrandedVec<u8>| {
    bvec1.push(12);
    let i1 = bvec1.push(13);
    let _idx = bvec1.get_index(0).unwrap();
    BrandedVec::new(vec2, move |mut bvec2: BrandedVec<u8>| {
        let i2 = bvec2.push(22);
        println!("{:?}", bvec2.get(i2)); // No bound check! Prints 22
        *bvec2.get_mut(i2) -= 1;         // No bound check!
        println!("{:?}", bvec2.get(i2)); // Prints 21
        println!("{:?}", bvec1.get(i1)); // Prints 13
        // rejected: i1 is not an index of bvec2
        // println!("{:?}", bvec2.get(i1));
    });
});
```

In terms of ergonomics, it's not exactly your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.

But through the `generativity` crate, we eliminate the rightward drift, changing just [nine lines](https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/generativity-pattern-rs/commit/806c8bef89b1d0c0621db42c130856bf33fffb9f) of `BrandedVec`'s implementation. The API now appears less foreign and more Rust-like.

```rust
let vec1: Vec<u8> = vec![10, 11];
let vec2: Vec<u8> = vec![20, 21];

make_guard!(guard1);
let mut bvec1 = BrandedVec::new(vec1, guard1);
bvec1.push(12)
let i1 = bvec1.push(13);
let _idx = bvec1.get_index(0).unwrap();

make_guard!(guard2);
let mut bvec2 = BrandedVec::new(vec2, guard2);
let i2 = bvec2.push(22);
println!("{:?}", bvec2.get(i2)); // No bound check! Prints 22
*bvec2.get_mut(i2) -= 1;         // No bound check!
println!("{:?}", bvec2.get(i2)); // Prints 21
println!("{:?}", bvec1.get(i1)); // Prints 13
// rejected: i1 is not an index of bvec2
// println!("{:?}", bvec2.get(i1))
```

The effort in bringing up this comparison has an ulterior motive. The original closure technique bears the exact same implementation caveat with `generativity`: nothing declared inside of the closures can escape it. `make_guard` effectively does the same thing as wrapping the rest of the function in an immediately invoked closure, and is no less capable than the closure technique.

<Aside collapse={false}>

StackOverflow user [rodrigo](https://stackoverflow.com/users/865874/rodrigo) [points out](https://stackoverflow.com/a/76876800) that you can achieve something similar to `generativity` using an anonymous unit struct and a macro to create the permutation group. Successive calls to this macro create permutation groups branded by this newly generated unit struct. In the context of our `Permutation` example, example usage looks like this (and you may check out the [full implementation](https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/generativity-pattern-rs/blob/main/src/6-unsound_token.rs)):

```rust
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! new_perm_group {
    ($len:expr, $mappings:expr) => {{
        let len = $len;
        let mappings = $mappings;
        struct InvariantToken;
        // SAFETY: private API, only used in this macro.
        unsafe {
            $crate::PermGroup::<InvariantToken>::new(len, mappings)
        }
    }};
}
```

```rust
let first_perm_group = new_perm_group!(4, vec![vec![1, 2, 0, 3]]).unwrap();
let second_perm_group = new_perm_group!(3, vec![vec![2, 0, 1]]).unwrap();
let first_perm = &first_perm_group.base_permutations()[0];
let second_perm = &second_perm_group.base_permutations()[0];

// rejected: `first_perm` and `second_perm` are not the same type
// first_perm.compose(second_perm);
```

The flaw is quite subtle. The macro constructor creates a token per-*call* instead of per-*owner*. Every expression results in a particular type; if the same macro is ran more than once, it will produce the same type. This can be exploited to give multiple owners the same brand. To exemplify:

```rust
let first = (4, vec![vec![1, 2, 0, 3]]);
let second = (3, vec![vec![2, 0, 1]]);

let mut perm_groups = vec![];
for (len, mappings) in [first, second] {
    perm_groups.push(new_perm_group!(len, mappings).unwrap());
}
let first_perm = &perm_groups[0].base_permutations()[0];
let second_perm = &perm_groups[1].base_permutations()[0];

// not rejected, UB!
first_perm.compose(second_perm);
```

We have just invoked undefined behavior from safe user-facing code. This is unsound without question.

There is a remedy: combine `InvariantToken` with a locally-scoped invariant lifetime, as [illustrated](https://codeberg.org/binarycat/typetoken/src/branch/trunk/src/lib.rs) in [binarycat](https://codeberg.org/binarycat)'s crate [`typetoken`](https://crates.io/crates/typetoken). This only creates a strictly less capable version of `generativity`. There is no point in endorsing either approach.

This offers a perspective as to why `Guard<'_>` cannot escape its defining scope. If the above code were possible, we would have the exact same unsoundness problem.

# How does `generativity` work?

At this point a good part of my readers are *itching* to know what makes `generativity` so magical compared to the age-old closure technique. The suspense is probably killing you. Or putting you to sleep. Either way, we will introduce how `generativity` works using a top-down approach. I have minimally rewritten the `generativity` crate

```rust
use std::marker::PhantomData;

pub type Id<'id> = PhantomData<fn(&'id ()) -> &'id ()>;

pub struct LifetimeBrand<'id>(PhantomData<&'id Id<'id>>);

impl<'id> LifetimeBrand<'id> {
    pub fn new(_: &'id Id<'id>) -> Self {
        LifetimeBrand(PhantomData)
    }
}

impl<'id> Drop for LifetimeBrand<'id> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {}
}

pub struct Guard<'id>(pub Id<'id>);

impl<'id> From<Guard<'id>> for Id<'id> {
    fn from(guard: Guard<'id>) -> Self {
        guard.0
    }
}

#[macro_export]
macro_rules! make_guard {
    ($name:ident) => {
        let branded_place: $crate::Id = std::marker::PhantomData;
        let lifetime_brand = $crate::LifetimeBrand(&branded_place);
        let $name = $crate::Guard(branded_place);
    };
}
```

Aren't lifetimes already unique?

In order to accomplish our goal, we need to construct a black box that the borrow checker can't penetrate. This involves two steps: disabling lifetime variance, and creating an inaccessible scope. Disabling variance is relatively straight forward. Several generic types disable variance in order to keep Rust sound. Getting into the details of this is fairly involved, so we will just say we can wrap a pointer in the standard library's Cell type as follows:

Of course we don't actually want to store a pointer at runtime, because we're only interested in creating a lifetime for the compiler to work with. Needing to signal that we contain a lifetime or type that we don't directly store is a sufficiently common requirement in Unsafe Rust that the language provides a primitive for exactly this: PhantomData. PhantomData tells the type system "pretend I contain this", while not actually taking up any space at runtime.

*(We benevolently assume . marking their constructors unsafe, newtyping `Id<'id>`)*

Let's get some low hanging fruit out of the way. It is easy to verify that `min_generativity` is zero-cost. Every single type is some form of `PhantomData`.

invariant as in type axiom is a noun while invariant as in subtyping is an adjective

&PhantomData needs a reference https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2040#issuecomment-317275303

there is a movement to make it a bit more ergonomic `PhantomInvariantLifetime` https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/135806

the make_guard!() macro creates an `Id<'id>` but also an `&'id Id<'id>` in the same scope

this forces the drop time of `'id` to be "in between" `&'id Id<'id>` and `Id<'id>`

common question: when does 'id drop? lifetimes are descriptive rather than prescriptive

since they are both in the same scope this "in between" area has no actual realization in the source code

This creates an invariant lifetime `'id` here, and ties it to the borrow of tag, which must live until the end of the current scope. i.e., we must have `&'id Id<'id>` at the make_guard! location, and have `&'id Id<'id>` at the drop location for make_guard!, where `'id` is an invariant lifetime

tag and _guard together guarantee that `'id` lives to a drop point that is different from the drop point of any other make_guard! created lifetime, so unifying the two lifetimes would be incorrect. It's also very important that neither tag nor _guard are leaked from our protected hygiene, as if they could be manipulated, the drop timing could potentially be changed.

no lifetime can unify with `'id` unless it can end in the same region.

The lifetime is, by definition, the time between when the value is created and when it is dropped, during which it is usable/alive.

The precise rules that govern drop checking may be less restrictive in the future.

The current analysis is deliberately conservative and trivial; it forces all borrowed data in a value to outlive that value, which is certainly sound.  Future versions of the language may make the analysis more precise, to reduce the number of cases where sound code is rejected as unsafe. This would help address cases such as the two Inspectors above that know not to inspect during destruction.

In the meantime, there is an unstable attribute that one can use to assert (unsafely) that a generic type's destructor is guaranteed to not access any expired data, even if its type gives it the capability to do so. That attribute is called may_dangle and was introduced in RFC 1327.

The above example will however fail if we add a manual Drop impl as the compiler conservatively assumes that all generic parameters of the Drop impl are used:

Why the `make_guard!(guard)` macro?

```rust
#![feature(super_let)] // [!code ++]

// ...

#[macro_export]
macro_rules! make_guard {
    ($name:ident) => { // [!code --]
        let branded_place: $crate::Id = std::marker::PhantomData; // [!code --]
        let lifetime_brand = $crate::LifetimeBrand(&branded_place); // [!code --]
        let $name = $crate::Guard(branded_place); // [!code --]
    }; // [!code --]
    () => {{ // [!code ++]
        super let branded_place: $crate::Id = std::marker::PhantomData; // [!code ++]
        super let lifetime_brand = $crate::LifetimeBrand::new(&branded_place); // [!code ++]
        $crate::Guard(branded_place) // [!code ++]
    }}; // [!code ++]
}

fn foo() {
    make_guard!(guard); // [!code --]
    let guard = make_guard!(); // [!code ++]
}
```

preliminary ideas https://blog.m-ou.se/super-let#a-potential-extension

any such weakening of an explicit impl Drop "using" captured lifetimes in the eyes of borrow check will be opt-in. This crate won't opt in to such a feature, and thus will remain sound.

[^exercise]

[^exercise]: With this explanation in mind, do you understand [rustc's error message](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2024&gist=744f80c92e2f96ba80e85bf87148919b) in this example, as an exercise to the reader?

# Benchmarks

No comparison would be complete without a benchmark. Yes, the point of the generativity pattern is more fundamental than just speed, but I know what people want. I statically generated two random length-fifteen permutations and wrote a Criterion benchmark for all five approaches to permutation composition.

| Benchmark Name | Time (ns) |
| -------------- | --------- |
| 1-slice        | 14.805    |
| 2-newtype      | 4.257     |
| 4-atomic_id    | 3.940     |
| 5-generativity | 3.604     |
| 3-unsafe_trait | 3.602     |

Empirically, this validates all of my observations. The naive `1-slice` is the slowest because it checks every permutation for complete validity during composition. `2-newtype` removes most of the validation overhead. Admittedly this is good enough; you would only care about the other solutions if you could prove that permutation composition was the bottleneck. `4-atomic_id` replaces the validation with a single integer comparison, making it marginally faster, likely because it avoids dereferencing. Finally, `5-generativity` and `3-unsafe_trait` emerge the fastest because they avoid validation entirely. The important difference: `3-unsafe_trait` marks permutation composition unsafe while `5-generativity` does not.

# Conclusion

Truthfully I don't have many final thoughts. I just needed a transition to end this article. I suppose my primary conclusion is that this article has gotten *far* longer than I had originally planned 😛.

I don't think this is a bad thing; its comprehensiveness more than makes up for it. The hidden agenda was to survey design patterns and write about design decisions I thought were interesting, culminating with the generativity pattern, which shows us how to take advantage of the type checker's power in a non-obvious manner.

This concludes the first technical write-up on my blog. I came into this topic with a surface level understanding of what `generativity` is and how it works. I was not expecting this to take many weeks of research and writing, and I was entirely unprepared for how interesting the full story would be. My posts only get more fun to write.

Thank you for reading this far. Until next time!
