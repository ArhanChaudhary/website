# Introduction

The *generativity pattern* in Rust is a combination of [typestate](https://cliffle.com/blog/rust-typestate/) and [GhostCell](https://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt/ghostcell/), techniques that move what you'd normally check at runtime to compile-time. This pattern is not commonplace; its usage warrants a specific set of circumstances. However, when it *is* used, such as in popular [garbage](https://github.com/kyren/gc-arena/?tab=readme-ov-file#prior-art) [collection](https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-gc) crates, the effect is pronounced.

Aside from thinly spread (but admittedly well-written) academic literature[^literature], I haven't a found an accessible analysis of this pattern online. In order to build up a full picture of the "what" and more importantly the "why," we will first spend some time walking through a realistic example to gauge the type of problem generativity can solve: statically requiring data to come from or refer to the same source, as a *stronger* form of ownership. The latter half of this article will explain how to use the generativity pattern and then introduce a novel approach to creating "lifetime brands."

[^literature]: Yes, I will eventually get to them. You just need to keep reading.

# Background

Let us take the role of a crate author about permutations. We want to investigate the [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_group#Composition_of_permutations–the_group_product) of permutations. This can be expressed nicely visually.

<PermutationExample />

The permutation `b` defines the remapping of the elements from permutation `a`. Pretty simple. Notice that permutation composition is only possible under the following three conditions:

1. `a` and `b` must have the same length.
2. Every element from `a` and `b` must be less than or equal to the length.
3. Every element from `a` and `b` must be unique.

Our library is general-purpose, so it is important to handle these error cases. Here is the simplest way to do that.

```rust
/// We provide a `compose_into` function in case the caller already
/// has a permutation preallocated. (This is good practice IMO).
pub fn compose_into(a: &[usize], b: &[usize], into: &mut [usize]) -> Result<(), &'static str> {
    if a.len() != b.len() || b.len() != into.len() {
        return Err("Permutations must have the same length");
    }
    let mut seen_b = vec![false; a.len()];
    let mut seen_a = vec![false; b.len()];
    for (into_value, &b_value) in into.iter_mut().zip(b) {
        if *seen_b
            .get(b_value)
            .ok_or("B contains an element greater than the length")?
        {
            return Err("B contains repeated elements");
        }
        seen_b[b_value] = true;

        let a_value = a[b_value];
        if *seen_a
            .get(a_value)
            .ok_or("A contains an element greater than the length")?
        {
            return Err("A contains repeated elements");
        }
        seen_a[a_value] = true;

        *into_value = a_value;
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

Good on you if this made you uneasy. Instead of validating `a` and `b` every time, Rust allows us to enforce at the type level that they are valid permutations, using the [newtype](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/patterns/behavioural/newtype.html) design pattern.

```rust
pub struct Permutation(Box<[usize]>);

impl Permutation {
    pub fn from_mapping(mapping: Vec<usize>) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        // This function errors if `mapping` is an invalid
        // permutation or its length does not match the second
        // argument. The implementation is ommitted.
        validate_permutation(&mapping, mapping.len())?;
        Ok(Self(mapping.into_boxed_slice()))
    }

    pub fn compose_into(&self, b: &Self, into: &mut Self) -> Result<(), &'static str> {
        if self.0.len() != b.0.len() || b.0.len() != into.0.len() {
            return Err("Permutations must have the same length");
        }
        for (into_value, &b_value) in into.0.iter_mut().zip(&b.0) {
            // SAFETY: `b` is guaranteed to be a valid permutation
            // whose elements can index `self`
            *into_value = unsafe { *self.0.get_unchecked(b_value) };
        }
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn compose(&self, b: &Self) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        let mut result = Self(vec![0; self.0.len()].into_boxed_slice());
        self.compose_into(b, &mut result)?;
        Ok(result)
    }
}
```

Unsafe is going to be a recurring theme here. You've had your fair warning.

The newtype pattern is more useful than just for getting around the [orphan rule](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/implementations.html#r-items.impl.trait.orphan-rule). We restrict construction of `Permutation` to `Permutation::from_mapping`, which returns an error if the input is not a valid permutation. That means if we have an instance of `Permutation`, we don't have to worry about its mapping being potentially invalid, reducing the validation overhead to a length check and permitting unsafe during permutation composition. Rustaceans describe type-level guarantees like this by saying an *invariant* of `Permutation` is that it represents a valid permutation. Composing two permutations upholds this invariant, so we expose `Permutation::compose` to create a new `Permutation` from existing ones.

This code is a major improvement! It is simple, easy to use, and it provides reasonable errors. However, a closer examination reveals some problems:

- Every call to our composition function spends time performing a length check. Our example is simplistic so it happens to be cheap, but this type of check may require more expensive logic in a practical scenario. Note that we can't use const generic lengths because our library operates on input provided at run-time.
- Returning a `Result` forces the caller to be prepared to handle the error variant. Library users might be able to guarantee that the length checks will pass, which would make the error handling more annoying than helpful.

Yes, these aren't *important* problems per se, but they are still inconveniences to be aware of.

We now want to extend our library to model a [permutation group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_group), or just a collection of a bunch of permutations. In a permutation group, every permutation can be written as a sequence of compositions of base permutations, which we will use to represent the entire collection. For example, the manipulations of the Rubik's Cube form a permutation group. Its base permutations which represent the entire permutation group are the six face rotations. Therefore, every possible state on the Rubik's cube can be reached from a combination of those face rotations.

The illustrated turn is a permutation fifty-four elements long, because there are fifty-four stickers on a Rubik's cube[^cube].

[^cube]: The center stickers don't actually move, and thus can be ignored, so the illustrated turn is traditionally simplified to a permutation forty-eight elements long.

<ContentImage src={stickeredCube} width="600" visualWidth="300" alt="The solved Rubik's cube" />

It follows that if you compose two permutations in a permutation group, the resulting permutation will also be a permutation in that group. You may reason about this fact from the information so far provided, but it is not relevant. Take this at face value.

A reasonable data structure for permutation groups looks like this:

```rust
pub struct PermGroup {
    base_permutation_length: usize,
    base_permutations: Vec<Permutation>,
}

impl PermGroup {
    pub fn new(
        base_permutation_length: usize,
        base_permutation_mappings: Vec<Vec<usize>>,
    ) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        for mapping in &base_permutation_mappings {
            validate_permutation(mapping, base_permutation_length)?;
        }
        Ok(Self {
            base_permutation_length,
            base_permutations: base_permutation_mappings
                .into_iter()
                .map(|mapping| Permutation(mapping.into_boxed_slice()))
                .collect::<Result<Vec<Permutation>, &'static str>>()?,
        })
    }

    pub fn base_permutations(&self) -> &[Permutation] {
        &self.base_permutations
    }
}
```

Your *inner Ferris* awakens. With the annoyances of our last iteration freshly in memory, you ask yourself: can we perform that length check once during the creation of the permutation group, and avoid it entirely in our permutation composition function? Then, can we tweak our composition function to only operate on permutations from the same permutation group?

```rust
impl Permutation {
    pub fn compose_into(&self, b: &Permutation, into: &mut Permutation) {
        for i in 0..into.0.len() {
            // SAFETY: ... ?
            unsafe {
                *into.0.get_unchecked_mut(i) = *self.0.get_unchecked(*b.0.get_unchecked(i));
            }
        }
    }

    pub fn compose(&self, b: &Permutation) -> Permutation {
        let mut result = Self(vec![0; self.0.len()].into_boxed_slice());
        self.compose_into(b, &mut result);
        result
    }
}
```

All of a sudden, the implementation of `Permutation::compose_into` opens up an unsafety hole, despite privatizing `Permutation`'s construction! We implicitly assumed that the permutations to compose were from the same permutation group. This is not necessarily true: what if a library user composes two base permutations from different permutation groups? If the permutation lengths *don't* match, then `get_unchecked` will exhibit undefined behavior; this is clearly a problem! The intent of this operation is obviously nonsensical, but it does not change the fact that it is still our responsibility, as the crate author, that the safe functions we provide can never exhibit undefined behavior.

There is a more fundamental reason to care. An invariant of permutation composition within the same permutation group is membership; if the permutations to compose are in the same permutation group, the resulting permutation is also in that group. Even if the lengths of permutations from two different permutation groups *did* match, composing them could produce a permutation outside of either group, which is a logic error. Mitigating this by checking permutation group membership every function call is a very expensive operation. This is an example of the "practical scenario" mentioned beforehand.

The newtype pattern alone is not powerful enough to prevent this error. We will analyze different approaches that ensure our library only permits permutation composition within the same permutation group. Each has their own trade-offs, but are all right answers for their own dedicated situations. They will also lay the groundwork to justify using the generativity pattern. All the code segments provided in this article can be found [here](https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/generativity-pattern-rs).

# The unsafe approach

The simplest solution is to mark `Permutation::compose_into` and `Permutation::compose` unsafe.

```rust
/// # Safety
///
/// `self`, `b`, and `into` must all be from the same
/// permutation group.
pub unsafe fn compose_into(&self, b: &Permutation, into: &mut Permutation) {
    for i in 0..into.0.len() {
        // SAFETY: permutations within the same group can be
        // composed.
        unsafe {
            *into.0.get_unchecked_mut(i) = *self.0.get_unchecked(*b.0.get_unchecked(i));
        }
    }
}
```

Although the extent of the undefined behavior with permutation composition is just the bounds checking, the goal of this approach is to enforce permutation group membership. Thus, the above safety contract is made more restrictive to reflect this idea. The usage of unsafe to maintain a validity invariant is contentious. Permutation composition of the same length within different permutation groups is a logic error, and it violates the safety contract, but is not technically unsafe. Sure, you might panic later on or get some other issue, but this alone will never exhibit undefined behavior.

To play devil's advocate, since we only care about composition within the same permutation group, one may consider producing an invalid value from this type of permutation composition undefined behavior. With the safety contract's additional restriction, calling code no longer has to worry about handling this logic error, while additionally gaining the contextual benefit of this assumption. Personally, I believe this use of unsafe is warranted—at the end of the day, the safety contract does still prevent undefined behavior. I encourage you to [have your own opinion](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/should-i-use-unsafe-merely-to-encourage-users-to-maintain-invariants/27856).

If you don't care about using unsafe—and there are valid reasons not to—then this might be what you want. That said, it's not always going to be this simple. What if we introduce a new trait, `ComposablePermutation`, that generalizes over different permutation representations? For example, the `PSHUFB` instruction can compose two permutations in a single clock cycle if they have less than sixteen elements.

```rust
pub trait ComposablePermutation: Clone {
    fn from_mapping(mapping: Vec<usize>) -> Result<Self, &'static str>;

    /// # Safety
    ///
    /// `self`, `b`, and `into` must all be from the same
    // permutation group.
    unsafe fn compose_into(&self, b: &Self, into: &mut Self);

    /// # Safety
    ///
    /// `self` and `b` must both be from the same permutation
    // group.
    unsafe fn compose(&self, b: &Self) -> Self {
        let mut result = self.clone();
        // SAFETY: `self`, `b`, and `result` are all from the
        // same permutation group.
        unsafe { self.compose_into(b, &mut result) };
        result
    }
}

impl ComposablePermutation for Permutation {
    // ...
}
```

The consequences of using unsafe begin to show. Because our generic `Permutation` implements `ComposablePermutation`, and we have shown that permutation composition from different permutation groups may cause undefined behavior, `Permutation::compose_into` must be made unsafe at the trait level. Rust doesn't allow us to only make `Permutation`'s implementation unsafe. Either all implementors must be made unsafe, or none at all. In a library *about* permutation composition, we have now forced our users to wrangle with unsafe for its most essential operation. Not just with `Permutation::compose_into`, but with all of their own implementations of `ComposablePermutation`!

*"That is completely unfair!"* You might say. *"This is a small edge condition I don't care about. I'm going to mark this trait method safe anyways."* Well, the Rust community generally has a zero-tolerance stance on undefined behavior; the last time someone wanted to mark an unsound method safe, [it didn't end very well](https://github.com/ogxd/gxhash/issues/82#issuecomment-2257578785).

# The atomic ID approach

The second approach is to validate our base permutations *upfront* and use a private integer to associate them to a unique permutation group. This simplifies the test for permutation group membership to a cheap integer comparison. Internalizing how this approach works will be crucial to understanding the generativity approach. Rereading is encouraged.

```rust
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicU64, Ordering::Relaxed};

pub struct PermGroup {
    base_permutation_length: usize,
    base_permutations: Vec<Permutation>,
    id: u64,
}

static ID: AtomicU64 = AtomicU64::new(0);

impl PermGroup {
    pub fn new(
        base_permutation_length: usize,
        base_permutation_mappings: Vec<Vec<usize>>,
    ) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        for mapping in &base_permutation_mappings {
            validate_permutation(mapping, base_permutation_length)?;
        }
        let id = ID.fetch_add(1, Relaxed);
        Ok(Self {
            base_permutation_length,
            base_permutations: base_permutation_mappings
                .into_iter()
                .map(|mapping| Permutation(mapping.into_boxed_slice(), id))
                .collect(),
            id,
        })
    }

    pub fn base_permutations(&self) -> &[Permutation] {
        &self.base_permutations
    }
}
```

The implementation of `PermGroup` does not actually change much. As before, we check that all mappings from `base_permutation_mappings` are valid permutations of the same length before creating a new `PermGroup`. This time, we utilize a global `AtomicU64` to uniquely identify the permutations in a permutation group, passing it as an integer to `Permutation`. The integer is guaranteed to be unique for `Permutation`s among different `PermGroup`s because we increment the identifier every call to `PermGroup::new`.

```rust
pub struct Permutation(Box<[usize]>, u64);

impl Permutation {
    pub fn from_mapping_and_group(
        mapping: Vec<usize>,
        group: &PermGroup,
    ) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        validate_permutation(&mapping, group.base_permutation_length)?;
        let permutation = Self(mapping.into_boxed_slice(), group.id);
        validate_permutation_group_membership(&permutation, &group.base_permutations)?;
        Ok(permutation)
    }

    pub fn compose_into(&self, b: &Self, into: &mut Self) -> Result<(), &'static str> {
        if self.1 != b.1 || b.1 != into.1 {
            return Err("Permutations must come from the same permutation group");
        }
        for i in 0..into.0.len() {
            // SAFETY: `self`, `b`, and `into` have the same ID.
            // Therefore, they are members of the same group and
            // can be composed.
            unsafe {
                *into.0.get_unchecked_mut(i) = *self.0.get_unchecked(*b.0.get_unchecked(i));
            }
        }
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn compose(&self, b: &Self) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        let mut result = Self(vec![0; self.0.len()].into_boxed_slice(), self.1);
        self.compose_into(b, &mut result)?;
        Ok(result)
    }
}
```

Creating a new `Permutation` now requires a mapping and a `PermGroup` reference. Once the mapping is verified as both a valid permutation and a member of that permutation group, only then is a new `Permutation` created with that `PermGroup`'s identifier, as a "token" of its membership. We can no longer create `Permutation`s willy-nilly from just a mapping because that would offer no guarantees about the uniqueness of its identifier.

The fruits of our labor are rewarded in `Permutation::compose_into`. The expensive permutation group membership test is performed exclusively during `Permutation`'s creation. When two permutations are composed, those same "tokens" are used to cheaply verify membership within the same permutation group. Hence, callers can safely assume permutation composition produces another permutation in the same permutation group without compromising efficiency.

It is worth taking a step back to reflect. Although this solution might be appreciated in academia, some programmers are likely to consider it over-engineered. I offer no rebuttal: indeed, you would need a good reason to care this much. However, if your interest is piqued, what would really be nice is an *infallible* yet *zero-cost* permutation composition operation—one that is guaranteed to be valid at compile-time and as fast as the unsafe approach. If you're willing to go a small step farther, we arrive at...

# The generativity approach

The big reveal: the generativity approach is equivalent to the atomic ID approach, except everything is done at compile-time. Generativity solves the fundamental problem thus far: the invariant of `Permutation` guarantees it is a valid permutation, but not that it is necessarily associated with a specific `PermGroup`.

Existing literature achieves generativity by sacrificing ergonomics and readability. They require wrapping all code in (often deeply nested) closures, warding off much of their interest in practice. We will spend the rest of this article examining Crystal Durham's [`generativity`](https://crates.io/crates/generativity) crate, which utilizes a novel and highly experimental technique to achieve generativity without needing a closure. Later, we will show that the `generativity` crate is a zero-cost compile-time abstraction.

*(Subtle-but-no-so-subtle foreshadowing: we will explore my own improvement to this technique in the next section)*

```rust
use generativity::{Guard, Id, make_guard}

fn main() {
    // Create a variable `guard` of type `Guard<'_>`
    make_guard!(guard);
    // Consume that `guard` into an `Id<'_>`
    let id: Id<'_> = guard.into();
}
```

`generativity` publicizes three things: `Guard`, `Id`, and `make_guard`. Invoking the `make_guard` macro creates a `Guard<'_>` with a let binding, an identifier that carries a guaranteed unique lifetime[^unique]. This lifetime is not actually used as a lifetime in the usual sense. It exists solely to make each instance of `Guard<'_>` a unique type. `Id<'_>` is like `Guard<'_>` except that it implements `Copy` and `Clone` while the latter does not. So, to create distributable copies of this identifier, you must consume a `Guard<'_>` into an `Id<'_>` using its `From` implementation. In terms of what `generativity` has to offer, this is all.

[^unique]: This lifetime is not technically unique. You could unify it with other lifetimes in a function call: `fn unify_lifetimes<'id>(impostor: &'id (), guard: &Guard<'id>) { ... }`. The lifetime is only unique among the provided `Id<'id>` and `Guard<'id>` types, so as long as your lifetime is carried by those types your code will be sound.

Let us informally prove `generativity`'s equivalence to the atomic ID approach:

- In the atomic ID approach, unique integer identifiers are created à la `ID.fetch_add(1, Relaxed)`. This directly parallels `make_guard!(guard)`, which creates a unique `Guard<'_>` identifier.
- The unique integer identifier is then stored inside a primitive `u64`. This implements `Copy` and it is distributed among the input base permutations to associate each one with its permutation group. Similarly, `Id<'_>` serves this same purpose.
- The unique integer identifier is used to test permutation group membership during permutation composition, erroring if not the case. Soon we will see how the generativity pattern correctly and equivalently solves this problem.

With their equivalence established, the body of `PermGroup::new` hardly changes at all. It remains sound because the constructor creates `Permutation`s with the same lifetime identifier, making it unique among different `PermGroup`s.

```rust
pub struct PermGroup { // [!code --]
pub struct PermGroup<'id> { // [!code ++]
    base_permutation_length: usize,
    base_permutations: Vec<Permutation>,
    id: u64, // [!code --]
    id: Id<'id> // [!code ++]
}
```

```rust
pub fn new(
    base_permutation_length: usize,
    base_permutation_mappings: Vec<Vec<usize>>,
    guard: Guard<'id>, // [!code ++]
) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
    for mapping in &base_permutation_mappings {
        validate_permutation(mapping, base_permutation_length)?;
    }
    let id = ID.fetch_add(1, Relaxed); // [!code --]
    let id = guard.into(); // [!code ++]
    Ok(Self {
        base_permutation_length,
        base_permutations: base_permutation_mappings
            .into_iter()
            .map(|mapping| Permutation(mapping.into_boxed_slice(), id))
            .collect(),
        id,
    })
}
```

Why is `guard` passed as an argument, and why isn't `make_guard` creating it within the function body? This reveals `generativity`'s implementation caveat: a `Guard<'id>` can never escape the scope it was defined in. Think of creating a `Guard<'id>` as creating a reference to a local variable. No matter what, it is only valid inside of its enclosing scope.

So, instantiating two different permutation groups, for example, looks like this:

```rust
make_guard!(guard1);
make_guard!(guard2);
let first = PermGroup::new(..., guard1);
let second = PermGroup::new(..., guard2);
// rejected: `guard1` used after move
// let third = PermGroup::new(..., guard1);
```

The purpose of `Guard<'id>` when `Id<'id>` already exists becomes clear when considering that `third` is rejected by the compiler. If `PermGroup::new` accepted an `Id<'id>`, two different permutation groups could be assigned the same `Id<'id>` because it implements `Copy`.

Okay, this is all fine and dandy, but how does this help improve permutation composition?

```rust
pub struct Permutation(Box<[usize]>, u64); // [!code --]
pub struct Permutation<'id>(Box<[usize]>, Id<'id>); // [!code ++]
```

Recall that every `Id<'id>` carries a unique lifetime among different `PermGroup<'id>`s. By combining `Permutation` with `Id<'id>` and a lifetime parameter, we create a set of the same `Permutation<'id>` type for each permutation that is distinct among different `PermGroup<'id>`s. Our permutation composition function takes in the same type `Self` for all arguments—it follows that `Permutation<'id>`s from different permutation groups cannot be composed as they are not the same type, and `Permutation<'id>`s from the same permutation group can be composed as they are the same type. This is the essence of the generativity pattern, enforced at compile-time.

Behold: a permutation composition function that is unchecked, infallible, and safe. The full implementation is [here](https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/generativity-pattern-rs/blob/main/src/5-generativity.rs).

```rust
pub fn compose_into(&self, b: &Self, into: &mut Self) -> Result<(), &'static str> { // [!code --]
    if self.1 != b.1 || b.1 != into.1 { // [!code --]
        return Err("Permutations must come from the same permutation group"); // [!code --]
    } // [!code --]
pub fn compose_into(&self, b: &Self, into: &mut Self) { // [!code ++]
    for i in 0..into.0.len() {
        // SAFETY: `self`, `b`, and `into` are members of the
        // same group and can be composed.
        unsafe {
            *into.0.get_unchecked_mut(i) = *self.0.get_unchecked(*b.0.get_unchecked(i));
        }
    }
    Ok(()) // [!code --]
}

It would be irresponsible for me to advertise the `generativity` crate as a perfect solution barring its implementation caveat. Yes, the implementation caveat is its only functional limitation, but there are some developer experience problems to consider.

- Although there's only a single line marked unsafe in our `Permutation<'id>` example, its soundness is now much harder to justify. It is on the developer to prove that `'id` uniquely associates permutations to their permutation group; any mishandling could easily make the whole thing unsound (i.e. if `PermGroup::new` took an `Id<'id>` instead of a `Guard<'id>`).
- The `'id` lifetime, like all other lifetimes, is pervasive. Data structures that wish to store `Guard<'id>` or `Id<'id>`, or any other data structure that stores `Guard<'id>` or `Id<'id>`, must have a lifetime annotation. But `make_guard` is typically invoked at the outermost scope, and will likely have to be passed through many types, so the number of lifetime annotations is amplified.
- Some APIs require types to satisfy `'static`. For example, the closure passed to `thread::spawn` must satisfy `'static`, making it impossible to return a `Permutation<'id>`. The workaround is usually an inconvenient band-aid; in this case the standard library offers `thread::scope` to borrow non-`'static` data in a thread.
- The compiler errors from misusing `generativity` don't provide the location of the error. They are generally confusing, even when you know how `generativity` internally works.

The atomic ID approach shares only the first problem. Given your use case, it might be what you want.

Notice how different instances of `Permutation<'id>` masquerade as separate types even though they have the same underlying data representation. In Rust, `'id` is known as a *branded lifetime*, or more generally, a *type brand*. The first principles of type branding date back at least to the work of John Launchbury and Simon Peyton Jones on the [ST monad in Haskell](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01018827) (section 2.5.2) in 1995. Aria Desires' [master's thesis](https://github.com/Gankra/thesis/blob/master/thesis.pdf) (section 6.3) brought this into the context of Rust in 2015, coining lifetime branding in Rust with the term "generativity." The more recent [GhostCell paper](https://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt/ghostcell/) by Joshua Yanovski and others utilized generativity to present interior mutability as a zero-cost abstraction in 2021.

This segways into an important point. The fundamental purpose of the generativity pattern is not necessarily to improve performance, but to statically require that individual values come from or refer to the same source. The performance benefits are a symptom of this requirement. I like to informally think of it as stronger form of ownership.

Aria Desires' master's thesis explores this idea with a simple example, `BrandedVec`. When the `i`th element of a vector `vec` is accessed through `&vec[i]`, a run-time check is performed to see if `i` is in bounds. If not, then the program will panic. However, in many situations we know that the indices are always in bounds; one such case regards the append-only vector. All elements pushed to this type of vector are forever valid. Leveraging this fact, the push operation returns the index of the pushed element so it can later be used to soundly perform unchecked indexing.

If we wanted to mark the unchecked indexing operation safe, this returned index can't be an ordinary `usize`. Bad actors may provide their own `usize` instead of one returned from the push operation. This returned index can't be a newtyped `usize` either. The problem with this is a microcosm of the problem with our initial `Permutation` example: different indices from different append-only vectors may be used to unsoundly index one another. To make our accesses safe, the solution is to lifetime brand the returned indices to statically associate them with `vec`—the generativity pattern.

As hinted to beforehand, generativity has traditionally only been achieved through the use of a closure. The GhostCell paper includes this following example, taken from its inspired [adaption](https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/FP/ghostcell/-/blob/master/ghostcell/examples/branded_vec.rs) of `BrandedVec`.

```rust
let vec1: Vec<u8> = vec![10, 11];
let vec2: Vec<u8> = vec![20, 21];

BrandedVec::new(vec1, move |mut bvec1: BrandedVec<u8>| {
    bvec1.push(12);
    let i1 = bvec1.push(13);
    let _idx = bvec1.get_index(0).unwrap();
    BrandedVec::new(vec2, move |mut bvec2: BrandedVec<u8>| {
        let i2 = bvec2.push(22);
        println!("{:?}", bvec2.get(i2)); // No bound check! Prints 22
        *bvec2.get_mut(i2) -= 1;         // No bound check!
        println!("{:?}", bvec2.get(i2)); // Prints 21
        println!("{:?}", bvec1.get(i1)); // Prints 13
        // rejected: i1 is not an index of bvec2
        // println!("{:?}", bvec2.get(i1));
    });
});
```

Each `BrandedVec` created from a `Vec` receives its own lifetime brand within each closure[^brandedvec]. In terms of ergonomics, it's not exactly your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.

[^brandedvec]: Rust doesn't have [rank-2 polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism#Higher-rank_polymorphism), so we need to replicate it using a closure with a [Higher-Rank Trait Bound](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/hrtb.html). The type signature of the closure passed to `BrandedVec::new` is `inner: impl for<'id> FnOnce(BrandedVec<'id, T>) -> R`, and this just means every call to `inner` must be prepared to handle an argument with any possible lifetime. Within a single function the compiler has perfect information, but calling `inner` inside `BrandedVec::new` tricks the borrow checker. Since it doesn't (and will likely never) do interprocedural analysis, it conservatively sees every call to `inner` as producing an opaque lifetime that can't unified with any other. To avoid any relation with an existing lifetime, a fresh new lifetime is statically generated for every call to `BrandedVec::new`, our lifetime brand for `BrandedVec<'id, T>`. This is just a brief overview of a well-investigated topic. Repeating for convenience, further reading is encouraged [here](https://github.com/Gankra/thesis/blob/master/thesis.pdf) (section 6.3) and [here](https://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt/ghostcell/) (section 2.2.1).

But through the `generativity` crate, we eliminate the rightward drift, changing just [nine lines](https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/generativity-pattern-rs/commit/806c8bef89b1d0c0621db42c130856bf33fffb9f) of `BrandedVec`'s implementation. The API now appears less foreign and more Rust-like.

```rust
let vec1: Vec<u8> = vec![10, 11];
let vec2: Vec<u8> = vec![20, 21];

make_guard!(guard1);
let mut bvec1 = BrandedVec::new(vec1, guard1);
bvec1.push(12)
let i1 = bvec1.push(13);
let _idx = bvec1.get_index(0).unwrap();

make_guard!(guard2);
let mut bvec2 = BrandedVec::new(vec2, guard2);
let i2 = bvec2.push(22);
println!("{:?}", bvec2.get(i2)); // No bound check! Prints 22
*bvec2.get_mut(i2) -= 1;         // No bound check!
println!("{:?}", bvec2.get(i2)); // Prints 21
println!("{:?}", bvec1.get(i1)); // Prints 13
// rejected: i1 is not an index of bvec2
// println!("{:?}", bvec2.get(i1))
```

Our digression in bringing up this comparison has an ulterior motive. The original closure technique bears the exact same implementation caveat with `generativity`: nothing declared inside of the closure can escape it. `make_guard` effectively does the same thing as wrapping the rest of the function in an immediately invoked closure, and is no less capable than the closure technique.

Let us offer another perspective as to why `Guard<'id>` cannot escape its defining scope. StackOverflow user [rodrigo](https://stackoverflow.com/users/865874/rodrigo) [points out](https://stackoverflow.com/a/76876800) that you can achieve something similar to `generativity` using an anonymous unit struct and a macro to create the permutation group. Successive calls to this macro create permutation groups branded by this newly generated unit struct. In the context of our `Permutation` example, example usage looks like this (and you may check out the [full implementation](https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/generativity-pattern-rs/blob/main/src/6-unsound_token.rs)):

```rust
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! new_perm_group {
    ($len:expr, $mappings:expr) => {{
        let len = $len;
        let mappings = $mappings;
        struct InvariantToken;
        // SAFETY: private API, only used in this macro.
        unsafe {
            $crate::PermGroup::<InvariantToken>::new(len, mappings)
        }
    }};
}
```

```rust
let first_perm_group = new_perm_group!(4, vec![vec![1, 2, 0, 3]]).unwrap();
let second_perm_group = new_perm_group!(3, vec![vec![2, 0, 1]]).unwrap();
let first_perm = &first_perm_group.base_permutations()[0];
let second_perm = &second_perm_group.base_permutations()[0];

// rejected: `first_perm` and `second_perm` are not the same type
// first_perm.compose(second_perm);
```

The flaw is quite subtle. The macro constructor creates a token per-*call* instead of per-*owner*. Every expression results in a particular type; if the same macro is ran more than once, it will produce the same type, even if it is unique to the expression. This can be exploited to give multiple owners the same brand. To exemplify:

```rust
let first = (4, vec![vec![1, 2, 0, 3]]);
let second = (3, vec![vec![2, 0, 1]]);

let mut perm_groups = vec![];
for (len, mappings) in [first, second] {
    perm_groups.push(new_perm_group!(len, mappings).unwrap());
}
let first_perm = &perm_groups[0].base_permutations()[0];
let second_perm = &perm_groups[1].base_permutations()[0];

// not rejected, UB!
first_perm.compose(second_perm);
```

We have just invoked undefined behavior from safe user-facing code. This is unsound without question.

There is a remedy: combine `InvariantToken` with a locally-scoped lifetime, as [illustrated](https://codeberg.org/binarycat/typetoken/src/branch/trunk/src/lib.rs) in [binarycat](https://codeberg.org/binarycat)'s crate [`typetoken`](https://crates.io/crates/typetoken). This only creates a strictly less capable version of `generativity`. There is no point in endorsing either approach.

If the above code were possible with `generativity`, we would have the exact same unsoundness problem.

# How does `generativity` work?

At this point a good part of my readers are *itching* to know what makes the `generativity` crate so magical compared to the age-old closure technique. The suspense is probably killing you. Or more likely putting you to sleep. We will introduce the inner workings of `generativity` top-down. I will first present my own minimal rewrite of the `generativity` crate, called `min_generativity`. Then, we will comprehensively walk through how each part of it works.

`min_generativity`

```rust
use std::marker::PhantomData;

pub type Id<'id> = PhantomData<fn(&'id ()) -> &'id ()>;

pub struct Guard<'id>(pub Id<'id>);

impl<'id> From<Guard<'id>> for Id<'id> {
    fn from(guard: Guard<'id>) -> Self {
        guard.0
    }
}

pub struct LifetimeBrand<'id>(PhantomData<&'id Id<'id>>);

impl<'id> LifetimeBrand<'id> {
    pub fn new(_: &'id Id<'id>) -> Self {
        LifetimeBrand(PhantomData)
    }
}

impl<'id> Drop for LifetimeBrand<'id> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {}
}

#[macro_export]
macro_rules! make_guard {
    ($name:ident) => {
        let branded_place: $crate::Id = std::marker::PhantomData;
        let lifetime_brand = $crate::LifetimeBrand::new(&branded_place);
        let $name = $crate::Guard(branded_place);
    };
}
```

Before we get started, let's get some low hanging fruit out of the way. We can verify that `min_generativity` is zero-cost. Every single type is some form of `PhantomData`, a zero-sized type that is optimized away at compile-time. However, there is a sharp corner: we create a reference to a `PhantomData` in `make_guard`, and references to zero-sized types are perhaps surprisingly [not zero-sized](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2040#issuecomment-317275303) due to some idiosyncrasies. Thus, we cannot prove `min_generativity` is zero-cost as Rust lacks a specification for optimization behavior. I claim that in practice this is the case the overwhelming majority of the time. The reference: is never used anywhere, is associated with an unused variable (`lifetime_brand`), and has no `Drop` impl. Even at the most basic optimization level, rustc is smart enough to [no-op everything](https://godbolt.org/z/ns5roTb5d).

Note that `min_generativity` benevolently assumes that library users will only use `make_guard` to construct `Id<'id>` and `Guard<'id>`, as both are public types with public field visibility. The actual `generativity` crate privatizes `Id<'id>` (via a newtype) and `Guard<'id>` and marks their constructors unsafe, hidden within `make_guard`. Such was omitted to be concise.

```rust
use std::marker::PhantomData;

pub type Id<'id> = PhantomData<fn(&'id ()) -> &'id ()>;
```

If you've only used `PhantomData` when the compiler has told you to, this certainly looks nonsensical. The purpose of `Id<'id>` as we saw earlier is to carry a *unique* lifetime brand among different `PermGroup<'id>`s, but aren't lifetimes already unique? What's the deal?

In Rust, *variance* determines whether you can substitute one lifetime for another. If you have a longer lifetime, Rust lets you use it where a shorter one is expected. This is also known as *subtyping*. Normally this is good—subtyping introduces static analysis that allows for more programs to compile—but in our case this automatic substitution works against our favor. If an `Id<'id>` can be tied to a lifetime other than its lifetime brand, we lose. So, the unique lifetime `'id` must have no subtyping relation with other lifetimes; `'id` is what's called an *invariant* lifetime.

The contemporary usage of the word "invariant" by Rustaceans has two meanings: one as a type-level guarantee (a noun), and one as a no-subtyping relation (an adjective). Invariant generally means something that cannot change or must be fixed to a specific value. Both meanings refer to this same general concept. We've been working with the first meaning so far, but for the rest of this article we'll switch to the second one.

To make `'id` invariant, we take advantage of a fundamental constraint with function pointer types. When you have `fn(&'id T) -> &'id T`, the caller provides a reference with lifetime `'id` and expects to get back a reference with that same lifetime `'id`. If Rust allowed the function pointer type to accept a longer lifetime but return a shorter one, or vice versa, it would break this explicit contract. You might pass in a reference that lives for ten seconds but get one back that lives for five seconds, creating a dangling pointer. Function pointer types with the same lifetime in the input and output positions force that lifetime to be invariant. No substitution allowed.

Of course, we don't actually want to store a function pointer at run-time. We only utilize it to make `'id` invariant at compile-time. The language provides `PhantomData` to enable fine-grained control over variance. In our case it tells the compiler to pretend like it holds a function pointer while not actually taking up any space.

<Aside collapse={false}>

Throughout the years lifetime invariance has been achieved in several other ways.

```rust
pub type Id<'id> = PhantomData<&'id mut &'id ()>; // Rust standard library
pub type Id<'id> = PhantomData<*mut &'id ()>; // GhostCell paper
pub type Id<'id> = PhantomData<Cell<&'id u8>>; // Aria Desires' master's thesis
pub type Id<'id> = PhantomData<Cell<&'id mut ()>>; // Also from her master's thesis
```

They work because they follow the core principal that `&mut T` is invariant over `T` (click [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/subtyping.html#variance) to see why). With `T = &'id ()`, `'id` must become invariant. But unlike the others, `PhantomData<fn(&'id ()) -> &'id ()>` implements all auto traits (`Sync`, `Send`, etc) for its owner, and is generally preferred if the only purpose is to indicate invariance. For more reading, the Rustonomicon lists [a table](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/phantom-data.html#table-of-phantomdata-patterns) of common `PhantomData` patterns.

</Aside>

When I first learned how to use `PhantomData` to indicate variance I couldn't help but think of it as an obnoxiously leaky abstraction. There is a [movement](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/135806) to make it a bit more ergonomic by introducing custom variance newtypes into the standard library, like `PhantomInvariantLifetime`. Sure enough, the status quo of `PhantomData` has been considered "[something of a failure](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3417#pullrequestreview-1396551771)."

```rust
pub struct Guard<'id>(pub Id<'id>);

impl<'id> From<Guard<'id>> for Id<'id> {
    fn from(guard: Guard<'id>) -> Self {
        guard.0
    }
}
```

The entire implementation of `Guard<'id>` is a newtype around `Id<'id>`. The established difference being that `Guard<'id>` doesn't implement `Copy` or `Clone`. We provide a `From` implementation to consume a `Guard<'id>` into an `Id<'id>` to create distributable copies of the lifetime brand, as we saw earlier.

```rust
pub struct LifetimeBrand<'id>(PhantomData<&'id Id<'id>>);

impl<'id> LifetimeBrand<'id> {
    pub fn new(_: &'id Id<'id>) -> Self {
        LifetimeBrand(PhantomData)
    }
}

impl<'id> Drop for LifetimeBrand<'id> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {}
}

#[macro_export]
macro_rules! make_guard {
    ($name:ident) => {
        let branded_place: $crate::Id = std::marker::PhantomData;
        let lifetime_brand = $crate::LifetimeBrand::new(&branded_place);
        let $name = $crate::Guard(branded_place);
    };
}
```

It turns out that disabling lifetime subtyping is not enough. While Rust believes it's unsound to freely resize `'id`, there’s nothing that constrains where `'id` should from. Consider the following system:

```rust
fn unify_lifetimes<'id>(_: &Id<'id>, _: &Id<'id>) {}

let id1: Id<'id1> = PhantomData;
let id2: Id<'id2> = PhantomData;
unify_lifetimes(&id1, &id2);
```

The constraint solver realizes there is no logical contradiction with the obvious solution of `'id1 = 'id2`, and it allows this program to compile. We need to uniquely tie `id1` and `id2` to their declarations to prevent Rust from unifying them.

After `make_guard` creates `branded_place` and generates an invariant lifetime `'id`, we are now armed with the knowledge to examine how `LifetimeBrand` ensures it is non-unifiable. It takes the approach of establishing distinct lower and upper bounds for `'id`, highlighting the need for a macro with protected hygiene to prevent these bounds from potentially being manipulated.

Notice that `LifetimeBrand` carries the phantom type `&'id Id<'id>` (to avoid actually storing the reference). The existence of `LifetimeBrand`'s `Drop` impl means this borrowed data could potentially be used at the end of the scope, special analysis called the [drop check](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#drop-check). Drop check forces the compiler to extend `'id` to live at the point where `lifetime_brand` is dropped, constituting our lower bound. The actual `Drop` impl is purposefully left blank.

An important guarantee from the compiler is that local variables in a scope are dropped in the opposite order they are defined. Now we must prevent successive `make_guard` invocations in the same scope from unifying with the first invocation whose lifetime lives the longest. We are left with a need to *upper-bound* `'id`, and this is done by tying `'id` to the *borrow of what created it*. So, any expanding of `'id` would mean `branded_place`'s borrow of lifetime `'id` wouldn't live long enough when it is dropped.

If you still find it confusing, I encourage you to work out rustc's error message [in this demonstration](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2024&gist=649d51907c2612c310eb627a0c863399). I also encourage you to play around with the code snippet to see what compiles and what doesn't. I've found this exercise illuminating. Another tip to help you understand is to remember the pithy saying that lifetimes are descriptive, not prescriptive.

## Soundness

It is easy to verify that `generativity` is sound.

```rust
make_guard!(id1);
make_guard!(id2);
assert_eq!(id1, id1);
assert_eq!(id2, id2);
// rejected: `branded_place` does not live long enough
// assert_eq!(id1, id2);
```

At the time of writing, this test case passes. However, `generativity`'s vice is that it relies on internal behavior from the drop check analysis, the precise rules of which have historically been ill-defined and subject to change. In theory, sufficiently advanced analysis would be able to see that dropping `lifetime_brand` doesn't require `'id` to live because its `Drop` impl is empty, destroying the uniqueness guarantee we have created.

<Aside collapse={false}>

The full extent of the current drop check analysis is detailed in a [t-types meeting document](https://hackmd.io/h9YBnIbaRSCD7Ej6hUpF_w). [TL;DR](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#drop-check).

</Aside>

Pertaining to our concerns, any weakening of drop check forcing captured lifetimes to live will most likely be opt-in, based on the direction of the ["drop check eyepatch" RFC](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1327-dropck-param-eyepatch.html). It introduces the unsafe `#[may_dangle]` attribute which relaxes this requirement. `#[may_dangle]` *opts-in* a struct's `Drop` impl to say, "I don't access a generic parameter, so it can be dropped before I run." Drop check eyepatch was introduced as a hacky refinement over "[unguarded escape hatch](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1238-nonparametric-dropck.html#unguarded-escape-hatch)," which permitted high-priority collections like `Vec<&T>` to drop despite the `&T` borrow being invalidated beforehand.

<ContentImage src={famousLastWords} width={1100} alt="A contributor commenting how this RFC was supposed to be a temporary fix" />

Here are some famous last words. Drop check eyepatch was accepted nine years ago, yet stabilization is [still opposed](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144729-t-types/topic/Perma-unstable.20status.20of.20.60.23.5Bmay_dangle.5D.60). There are too many subtle gotchas with respect to drop check that have been found to be too much of a footgun even for an internal compiler feature. It has resulted in unsoundness [multiple](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76367) [times](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/99408). The stable analysis is deliberately conservative for this reason. To quote from the Rustonomicon's [explanation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/dropck.html#an-escape-hatch) of `#[may_dangle]`, "it is better to avoid adding the attribute."

The [existing avenue of improvement](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3417) clarifies the semantics but still holds that this behavior will be *opt-in*. Hence, we can strengthen our confidence that the livelihood requirements for `generativity` will remain sound.

There are two other soundness concerns that are unlikely to be problematic but are still brought up in brief:

- `generativity` relies on an unused variable, `lifetime_brand`, to impact borrow checking and the drop check. If support for unused variable analysis is ever removed, then [`scopeguard`](https://crates.io/crates/scopeguard), a crate with hundreds of millions of downloads, would break, and Rust is very careful not to break existing code. `scopeguard` [also relies](https://docs.rs/scopeguard/latest/src/scopeguard/lib.rs.html#287) on the `Drop` impl of an unused variable. Additionally, with the drop check, borrow checking must also run by virtue of `lifetime_brand`'s `Drop` impl, which could possibly access the borrow[^unreachable].
- It may still be hard to trust the delicate configuration of upper and lower bounding the generated lifetime. With [non-lexical lifetimes](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/08/05/nll-by-default/) stabilized in 2022 as the second edition of the borrow checker, the only planned next iteration is [Polonius](https://github.com/rust-lang/polonius?tab=readme-ov-file), the implementation of which currently [passes](https://rust.godbolt.org/z/vhMjKGbz3) the aforementioned test case. I haven't given it much thought, but proving `generativity`'s soundness with Polonius' formal model of the borrow checker would be a fun project (to me at least).

[^unreachable]: Unreachable code on the other hand is *not* borrow checked because it simply [wasn't a priority](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/91377#issuecomment-993875185).

## Language support

The `make_guard` macro almost has everything going for it, but the elephant in the room is that it looks ugly. It injects local variables defined by let bindings into the current scope, and we saw this was necessary in the statement-position to prevent the lifetime bounding tricks from being manipulated. For a while there was no ultimatum, until just a few months ago when the experimental [`super let`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/139080) feature was introduced to extend the lifetimes of block-scoped variables. On nightly Rust, expression-position `make_guard` is now possible.

```rust
#![feature(super_let)] // [!code ++]

// ...

#[macro_export]
macro_rules! make_guard {
    ($name:ident) => { // [!code --]
        let branded_place: $crate::Id = std::marker::PhantomData; // [!code --]
        let lifetime_brand = $crate::LifetimeBrand::new(&branded_place); // [!code --]
        let $name = $crate::Guard(branded_place); // [!code --]
    }; // [!code --]
    () => {{ // [!code ++]
        super let branded_place: $crate::Id = std::marker::PhantomData; // [!code ++]
        super let lifetime_brand = $crate::LifetimeBrand::new(&branded_place); // [!code ++]
        $crate::Guard(branded_place) // [!code ++]
    }}; // [!code ++]
}

fn main() {
    make_guard!(guard); // [!code --]
    let guard = make_guard!(); // [!code ++]
}
```

Furthermore, there are [preliminary ideas](https://blog.m-ou.se/super-let#a-potential-extension) that would allow `make_guard` to be a function instead of a macro. The feedback for `super let` has so far been positive, so once the semantics are ironed out I think efforts to stabilize this feature will be underway.

My last contribution to this discussion is some wishful thinking about first-class language support for `generativity`. The troubles with unique lifetime branding stem from the fact that Rust offers no way to prevent lifetimes from unifying. I propose the `'nonunifiable` lifetime bound, which would allow lifetimes to declaratively guarantee nonunifiability[^word] without having to resort to `generativity`'s lifetime bounding tricks. `'nonunifiable` is not intended to indicate variance—that's the job of `PhantomData`. For the permutation example, first-class support from the compiler would look like this:

[^word]: Is this even a word?

```rust
pub struct PermGroup<'id: 'nonunifiable> {
    base_permutation_length: usize,
    base_permutations: Vec<Permutation<'id>>,
    id: PhantomData<fn(&'id ()) -> &'id ()>
}

pub struct Permutation<'id>(Box<[usize]>, PhantomData<fn(&'id ()) -> &'id ()>);
```

Maybe this addition will have an unexpected use case that would make it practical, or maybe not. I'm not going to pretend I've thought about it more than this.

# Benchmarks

No comparison would be complete without a benchmark. Yes, the point of the generativity pattern is more fundamental than just speed, but I know what people want. I statically generated two random length-fifteen permutations and wrote a Criterion benchmark for all five approaches to permutation composition.

| Benchmark Name | Time (ns) |
| -------------- | --------- |
| 1-slice        | 14.805    |
| 2-newtype      | 4.257     |
| 4-atomic_id    | 3.940     |
| 5-generativity | 3.604     |
| 3-unsafe_trait | 3.602     |

Empirically, this validates all of my observations. The naive `1-slice` is the slowest because it checks every permutation for complete validity during composition. `2-newtype` removes most of the validation overhead. Admittedly this is good enough; you would only care about the other solutions if you could prove that permutation composition was the bottleneck. `4-atomic_id` replaces the validation with a single integer comparison, making it marginally faster, likely because it avoids dereferencing. Finally, `5-generativity` and `3-unsafe_trait` emerge the fastest because they avoid validation entirely. The important difference: `3-unsafe_trait` marks permutation composition unsafe while `5-generativity` does not.

# Conclusion

Truthfully I don't have many final thoughts. I just needed a transition to end this article. I suppose my primary conclusion is that this article has gotten *far* longer than I had originally planned 😛.

I don't think this is a bad thing. Its comprehensiveness more than makes up for it. The hidden agenda was to survey design patterns and write about Rust code I thought were interesting, culminating with the generativity pattern, which shows us how to take advantage of the type checker's power in a non-obvious manner.

This concludes my first educational write-up on my blog. I came into this topic with a surface level understanding of what `generativity` is and how it works. I was not expecting this to take a month of writing, and I was entirely unprepared for how interesting the full story would be. My posts only get more fun to write >:).

Thank you for reading this far. Until next time!
