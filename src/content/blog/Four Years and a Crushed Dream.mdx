at the climax of borrasca by C K Walker, one of my favorite horror stories of all time, the protagonist finds out that his two best friends from childhood are 1) almost beaten to death 2) trafficked as a sex slave. not good outcomes. then he realizes that his dad was in on it the entire time, double whammy. This is an excerpt from the story

"Is anyone going to file a police report? Does anyone even fucking care what happened?"

"Sam." He didn't turn to look at me. "I am doing my best to do damage control on the situation but if Kyle dies or his parents sue, there's nothing I can do to keep you out of court."

"You think I did this?" I screamed at him.

"We're not going to tell your mother. Alright? She has enough to worry about."

"Dad, it's- I- Kimber- it was fucking Prescott! And Sheriff Clery!"

"Yes, you arrived at the hospital in Killian's truck. We already talked to them both."

I was so frustrated and full of rage that my next words came out a jumbled, stuttering mess that ended in a helpless scream. We pulled into our driveway and my dad turned off the car and finally turned to look at me as I struggled to catch my breath.

...

"Enough! If you want this to go away you will keep your mouth shut about it, make no statements to anyone and I'll hire the best lawyer I can afford to clean up your mess. I don't know why you beat your best friend almost to death and frankly I don't want to. You-"

"Fuck you!" I screamed at him and threw open the door to the cruiser. I ran then, away from him and the house and my broken life. He didn't come after me. Not that day or any other.

i am no where near as unfortunate as the protagonist but I felt a connection towards the end, I have such an overwhelming feeling about timeweb that my attempts at trying to express myself in person would be as feeble as what the author has written
