{/* cspell:ignore binaryen rustwasm */}

We've all known and loved Rust's wasm-pack for generating WebAssembly packages. Did you know that it provides dozens of obscure optimization flags hiding in plain sight?

Let's first take a look at the available optimization flags from wasm-pack's documentation.

```toml
[package.metadata.wasm-pack.profile.dev]
# Should `wasm-opt` be used to further optimize the wasm binary generated after
# the Rust compiler has finished? Using `wasm-opt` can often further decrease
# binary size or do clever tricks that haven't made their way into LLVM yet.
#
# Configuration is set to `false` by default for the dev profile, but it can
# be set to an array of strings which are explicit arguments to pass to
# `wasm-opt`. For example `['-Os']` would optimize for size while `['-O4']`
# would execute very expensive optimizations passes
wasm-opt = ['-O']
```

For most people, `-O4` is enough, case closed, but it is easy to overlook an important detail. wasm-opt isn't a tool from Rust, but rather a Rust-facing wrapper around [binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen)'s wasm-opt, the C++ toolchain infrastructure that actually does the meat of the work. You never could have known this if you were new to rustwasm, as it's omitted from the documentation.

You have to dig through source to find the full list of binaryen's wasm-opt optimization flags. Bizarrely, the only mention of the list in fine print is within this test file.

Shrouded within the codebase, these few extra flags are actually useful in extreme optimization cases. Namely, in my case, `--flexible-inline-max-function-size` boasts a respectful **40%** speed improvement while increasing my WebAssembly file size from 67KB to 83KB.

`Cargo.toml`

```toml
...
[package.metadata.wasm-pack.profile.release]
wasm-opt = [
    "-O4",
    "--flexible-inline-max-function-size",
    "4294967295",
]
...
```

These are just the "Optimization options". There exists an even *larger* list of around 150 "Optimization passes" within the same test file.

```

I spent almost an entire day testing out the effectiveness of each flag to little avail. A lot of these flags aren't even optimizations, and the ones that are were all seemingly ineffectual. If you're looking to hyper-optimize your binaryen WebAssembly you're better off sticking with the "Optimization options" flags. You may also find useful the [optimizer cookbook](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/wiki/Optimizer-Cookbook) and the [GC optimization guidebook](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/wiki/GC-Optimization-Guidebook) from binaryen's wiki.

Coming to think about it, this post doesn't have to be about wasm-pack at all, as the topic more closely concerns binaryen. I thought it was important to frame this post from a Rust point of view because of how surprisingly obscure this information is to wasm-pack users new to the WebAssembly pipeline. I have opened a [pull request](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/pull/1423) that explicitly references the full list of available wasm-opt flags in wasm-pack's documentation to make them easier to find.
