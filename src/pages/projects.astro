    I've always been a sucker for project-based learning. With each new programming
    endeavor, I try to build something more ambitious than the last one!

      NAND is a Turing equivalent 16-bit computer made entirely from a clock and
      NAND gates emulated on the web. NAND features its own CPU, machine code
      language, assembly language, assembler, virtual machine language, virtual
      machine translator, programming language, compiler, IDE, and user
      interface. NAND is based on the Jack-VM-Hack platform specified in the <a

      TimeWeb is a time management application that visualizes, quantifies, and
      prioritizes your daily school or work assignments. Unlike typical
      planners, TimeWeb splits up and graphs all of your work until they are
      due. Every day, know what to do, when to do it, and how long it will take.
      <br />
      <br />
      TimeWeb was primarily a high school project; I even gave a couple school presentations
      on it. Although TimeWeb is easily the project I've put the most effort into,
      I have yet to officially launch or promote it.

      A weekend project I made for Purdue's Hello World 2023 hackathon with my
      collegiate (and now my best) friends. It uses ChatGPT to summarize GitHub
      profiles in a bullet-point format to help users write their resumes.
      <br />
      <br />
      Placed 3rd out of 150 participants.

      My solutions for all 25 days of Advent of Code 2023 to familiarize myself
      with Rust. I had wanted to completely finish a year of Advent of Code for
      a long time, so this was a huge personal accomplishment for me :)

      We can't forget! My personal website itself has taken a nontrivial amount
      of time to write, design, and maintain. I'm quite proud of what I have so
      far!
