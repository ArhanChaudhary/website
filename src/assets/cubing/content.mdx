{/* cspell:ignore speedcubing CFOP sune */}

I can't specifically remember when, but my cubing journey started in middle school when I found a Rubik's cube at a birthday party and learned to solve it myself using the [CFOP method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFOP_method). Since then:

- My personal best solve time is 6.48 seconds
- My average solve time is around 11 seconds
- I can solve Rubik's cubes blindfolded (it took me seven attempts for my first and only successful solve)
- I've attended {(await getCollection("cubing-competition")).length} speedcubing competitions (my [WCA profile](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2018CHAU01))

For *now*, I only practice 3x3, but hopefully I'll find later motivation to learn other twisty puzzles.

## 3x3 Main

My 3x3 Rubik's cube main is the GAN 14 3x3 Magnetic (MagLev UV Coated)

Fancy, I know right? When I got this cube in particular, I started an experiment and adjusted the tensioning towards the faster end. In the past, I always adjusted the tension towards the slower end because I would apply too much force while turning and tire me out.

Although it was hard getting used to at first, so far I think the experiment has worked! Hopefully this isn't just a placebo, but I feel like turning has been easier than ever.

## Personal Best Solve

This solve is one-of-a-kind. For perspective, from around ten thousand prior career solves, my previous personal best was 8.62 seconds. It was my most dramatic personal best solve time jump, and no other solve time other than <a href="https://alg.cubing.net/?type=reconstruction&setup=B-_R_D2_L-_F2_L-_U2_F2_L-_F2_R-_F2_B-_L-_R2_D-_R-_F_L-&alg=x2_y_%2F%2F_Inspection%0AD-_R-_D2_F_B-_R_D2_%2F%2F_Cross%0AL-_U_L_y-_R-_U2_R_%2F%2F_1st_Pair%0AL_F-_L-_F_L_U_L-_%2F%2F_2nd_Pair%0Ay-_U_R-_U-_R_%2F%2F_3rd_Pair%0AU_R_U_R-_%2F%2F_4th_Pair%0Af_R_U_R-_U-_f-_U-_R_U_R-_U-_R-_F_R_F-_%2F%2F_OLL%0A%0A%2F%2F_Solved_on_Dec_5,_2022&title=Arhan%20Chaudhary,%206.82%20seconds&view=playback">this contender</a> has come close after more than five years.

Before picking up the cube, you can already tell that the solve presents a special opportunity. There exists not one, but <i>two</i> completed 2x2x1 F2L blocks. Complemented by easy edges, the solve manifests a rare XX Cross! Following that, the third and fourth pairs were easy-to-look-ahead 2-gen algorithms that each required a rotation for setup.

I couldn't have asked for a better last layer. The fat anti-sune, already U-face oriented, is one of my fastest OLL algorithms. On the other hand, I was met with a Ja PLL, an algorithm I've historically locked up on. My execution was flawless and aided by the 25% chance of no AUF. Given that I've always struggled with solve anxiety especially towards the end of the solve, I can't help but give myself a pat on the back for how elegant the last layer was. Through the culmination of an awesome scramble and perhaps an even more awesome solution, my 6.48 second Rubik's cube solve is forever cemented as one of my proudest life accomplishments!
